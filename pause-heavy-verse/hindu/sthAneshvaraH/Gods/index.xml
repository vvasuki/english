      <description>Altar Bird
O fire of time,
Incinerate this body,
From toe to head,
And let ambrosia flow,
Soaking the ashes,
Rejuvenating it,
And let me fly with new wings,
For I am the altar bird.
O time-eater,
I have seen you at the edge,
Of being and non-being,
Always empty and full.+++(5)+++
For long ago,
I have lost passion for both,
To be and not to be,
For I am the altar bird.</description>

      <description>Apara
In the night of the new moon,
Assuming the dark body of Apara,
Hidden in the dark,
With disheveled deep dark hair.
You think you are hidden from me!
Stop this hide and seek game,
You lack the skills to hide yourself,
As your eyes,
like the lakes filled with love,
Shine like the moon and the sun,
Revealing all the realms.

घनान्धकारे तमसावृता सति ॥

      <description>Ma Camunda!
Why torment this heart,
As you own all its beats,
And ask me,
The secrecy of mudrā,
The complexity of maṇḍala,
The rhythms of mantra.
Why speak through me,
As you can enlighten all hearts.
Let this speck of dust,
Stuck somewhere in thy feet,
Be free of this world,
For the darkness has gone too long,
And the fire has been stolen,
Let me see thy face,</description>

      <description>Kali
Mother - the world is fearsome,
Let me stay in your belly,
I beg you chew me with your sharp teeth,
And dissolve me within you.+++(5)+++
Oh Karankini, do not let me escape your grips,
Ghosts and goblins in the cremation ground,
Are one thousand times better than maya.+++(4)+++
Oh Krodhana, have mercy on me,
Let the fire of your rage burn me alive,
And dissolve me in your purity.</description>

      <title>sevA and non-duality</title>

      <description>Non-duality of Sevā
Problem It makes sense that we do not call sevā when we are serving ourselves, when we are fulfilling our own needs or when there is nobody but ourselves benefitting from it. But this raises a question, can we perform sevā recognizing non-duality? How can a liberated person who does not recognize the other as the other still serve the other?
Duality within non-duality The premise that sevā rests on duality is a huge misconception.</description>

      <description>Vishalakshi
A hermit in Banaras told me the first day,
&amp;ldquo;You come here to learn, or to die.&amp;rdquo;
Seeing me intrigued,
He added, &amp;ldquo;and they are one and the same.&amp;rdquo;
Perplexed, I strolled through the cremation grounds,
Inhaling the air infused with the aroma of flesh.
First death came with Vedanta,
With realization that the I that went there was no more.
And came the Sautrantikas+++(??)+++,
Pushing my being to annihilation.</description>
