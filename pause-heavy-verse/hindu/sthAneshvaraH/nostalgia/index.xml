      <description>Crossroads
Souls do not depart,
Only their ways.+++(4)+++
When shadows devour the face,
Laughter lingers,
Like a distant echo.
Picking up a few pieces,
Of the looks or the smiles,
From the shores of the vanishing point,
And failing to assemble an image,
Enlivens half-memories,
Of half-kindled love,
Of half-walked journey,
Touching the heart-core,
With a sweet agony.
Only the ways depart,
And faces vanish,
But tears linger with heartbeats.</description>

      <description>The last resonance,
The last echo,
I only got a glimpse of some shadows,
A minute before the sunset,
A moment before emptiness.
Some sweet memories erupt,
Mixed with some tears,
Before all forms vanish,
I envisage,
And savor the last bits of echos,
Relish the last glimpse shadows.
I ask time,
To freeze for me for a bit,
I ask the sun,
To slow down for a bit,
All in vain,</description>

      <description>Retaining the vanishing shadows,
From the nostalgic past,
As her image descends to oblivion.
Striving to capture a moment,
Before it melts like a snowflake.
Seizing the moment of collecting the pieces,
Of the glass that once mirrored her,
Suspending pulsation,
the beats of aham,
Being there to capture the last simulation.
I have not waited enough,
For eternity spreads incessantly,
With floating particles like me.
Just a tiny firefly in the tempest.</description>

      <description>Lost
So close, so intimate,
Yet so forgotten is life.
Like the autumn leaves,
Waving with the final shower of beauty,
Before splitting from the mother tree.
A moment of nostalgia,
A moment of anguish,
Recalling sweet and sour footprints,
This is all I got,
In my lost time, walking through the sunset cliffs.
Some friends faded in memory,+++(4)+++
Others, swept in the tides of time.
Some chose to forget me,+++(5)+++</description>

      <description>You Gave me the being of first pulsation
And from the dark of nothingness,
Brought me to the light of being.
You as the ripples of ah and m,
Gave first beats to the tiny heart,
And thus gave body to the being that was not there before.
You Shared your first breath,
And breathed through the tiny lungs,
Giving its first rhythms.
I live a borrowed being,
Now both as being and absence,</description>

      <description>Recall
I know I lost something,
I quite forget what it is,
The urge inside like tidal waves,
Shake me numb, begging to recall.
Shuffling faces and scrolling down pages,
Names and forms appear and vanish,
I urge myself to remember,
It is like dense darkness,
Or a thick fog covering all-around,
Like a cataract of the mind,
The one that Vasubandhu had,
But now may be I recall,
These must be the words,</description>

      <description>The Sunrise
Remember the days when we would run out to the new sun every morning and sing with birds and run with the wind? I am not talking about you but about those who were born before the machine age. In those days kids were allowed to have a life and our growth was not measured on the equations we could solve. When I walked out to the sun this morning, I reminisced the first touch of sunlight in the morning and I could not stop indulging myself of being in the nature even though I myself have sold my soul to the machine life.</description>

      <description>Vanishing point
Family and friends,
Colleagues and acquaintances,
Do you ever feel?
There is a vanishing point,
Where the real characters,
Appear as familiar as the movie characters,
Like a comet tail,
Starting from the pole of the heart,
To the pitch dark oblivion,+++(5)+++
As if from the brilliance of sunlight,
To the night of the new moon,
My throbbing heart seeks rest,
Not in light but in the new moon,</description>
