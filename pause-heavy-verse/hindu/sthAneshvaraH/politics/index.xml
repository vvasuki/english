      <description>I was told not to walk on grass,
or move rocks,
for they also had the right to be the way they were.
for my presence should not shadow their being.
I do not know,
how to come out of silence,
for words have been poisoned the mouths that once chanted mantras.
I was told,
I had the spells to heal the world.
this must be another world.
for people here play in blood.</description>

      <description>महा-सिद्ध-धर्मः you had another question, if Mahasiddhas like Khaptad Baba +++(who was from kAshmIr)+++ were concerned about Kashmir issues.
My answer is, NO. As far as I can tell, they were not at all concerned about those issues.

      <description>My father used to say, you value what you earn and not what you inherit. I realize its depth as days go by and as I witness the rise of despotism. If my generation fought for democracy, the new generation is fighting to reinstall dictatorship. And they say, it is for the better.
I remember being arrested one dark night alongside some hundred colleagues.
I was fortunate to have been released after 18 hours of interrogation</description>

      <description>I feel immobile,
And empty of words,
Witnessing the ways blood is spilled,
In the streets to make dystopia great again.
Going back to Shastras,
Wanting to make sense of the events,
Make me thoughtless,
As there is nothing on earth,
To make Buchenwald+++(=A nAzi camp)+++ great again.+++(5)+++
This has been like watching,
The Mount Everest collapse,
And all the mountains, to make a gopher hill tall again.
I marched in the streets when sixteen,</description>

      <description>Leaders come and go,
Prophets come and go,
Even God incarnates again and again,
It is the humanity that I am worried about.
Seasons change as the Fall or the Spring,
Youth is not granted forever and ever,
Those drunken with grief or ecstasy,
Shall not compromise decency forever.
I naively strolled out of my university hostel,
And landed in a historic museum behind the forest,
And entered with curiosity, waiting in line,</description>

      <title>Tears not cheap</title>

      <description>My tears are not so cheap
There is no counting of the times I have cried - Sometimes even not knowing why.
I remember crying, actually following my sister,
when the doctor gave up on my mother.
My father asked why was I crying and since I did not know,
I looked at my sister.
Mother survived but I never forgot the scene.
I remember some drops falling when I was with my friends offering flowers to BP Koirala.</description>

      <description>the mirror
the mirror had to go,
for the stories it came with,
that it was a haunting mirror,
in a topsy turvy mirror world,
a clown+++(→ Trump)+++ believing himself an emperor,
they all wanted to hang the mirror,
some to admire and others, to punish.
but the pietists,
broke the mirror being outraged,
in the dark of a night,
for they all were embarrassed,
to see their face in the mirror.</description>
