      <description>Let me tell you a story. One fine day, I was gossiping, strolling with one of the richest friends I ever had. Going to the opposite direction on the other side was a homeless couple, with their bags hanging on shoulder. My friend suddenly started laughing. When I asked what is the matter? she pointed to the other direction and said, &amp;lsquo;how cute, a hobo couple.&amp;rsquo;
Very few among you know that I was on the street at one point in my life.</description>

      <description>I am in mood today to share you some stories that I have never shared with anybody. It was around 1989. I was back to Kathmandu that time and my guruji [Prem Chetan] insisted that I perform the ritual of life-installation for one temple. I was actually commissioned by Aishwarya Shaha, the Queen of Nepal. And for the days long life-installation prāṇa-pratiṣṭhā ritual ( Krishna temple in Bhimsengola, Purano Baneshwar), the queen gave me six rupees [about a dime] for dakṣiṇā.</description>
