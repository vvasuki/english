      <description>Where can I find a word,
that you and I can share,
not a simulation from the ghosts,
but a word that resonates the heart,
and ignites the same passion,
that you and i rediscover each other,
in the agonies and pangs of each other,
that you can hear without your ears,
not because my words are significant,
but because they mean something to me.</description>

      <description>Conference
They were out there,
In a humid Weimar summer,
Catching a breath,
In between conference panels.
She had a stash but he was out,
They shared the smoke and laughed,
And they loved and kissed,
And made a vow,
Of every moment,
And in between,
To not ever be apart,
When the cigarette was gone,
And the break was over,
They left to not see each other again.+++(4)+++</description>

It was love in first sight,
Or better say, first touch,
When my teacher gave it+++(a book)+++ to me,
Sharing the gift that was from his teacher.
We have journeyed around the globe together,
And have remained a loyal companion for each other,
I do not know who I am any more,
Were I to expunge the book that is in me.+++(5)+++

      <description>When I say I was 12 when I left home in search for knowledge,
people admire me and look at me with disbelief.
I didn’t run away. My father walked with me for an entire hour till the dawn.
My father didn’t have this luxury.
He left home to go to Gurukula at the age of six. All by himself.
Unfortunately my grandfather passed away when my father was ten</description>

      <description>Formed as shadows,
Part unfinished,
Crawl around and complain,
Eager like children running around,
The world is not a place for the speech to unfold.
In the speech I offer myself,
Vac,
the pristine expression of being as such,
Not as me and you but both me and you.
The song I have cannot be sung,
As I am one with the song,
And when I come out the song is gone.</description>

      <description>Today the memory of professor Rishi Ram Pokhrel is resurfacing since early morning.
I am not connected with him in any social media
but if any of you are in contact with him, please convey my regards.
Particularly coming vivid today is an incident that changed my life forever.
When I was an undergraduate student, professor Pokhrel was the college principal.
One evening when I was heading out of campus, the college guard stopped me and said,</description>

      <description>What can the world learn from Bharata In one of my conversations in India, I told my students, the world can learn from Bharata just two concepts of sacrifice (tyāga) and asceticism (tapasyā). First of all, both the words are not properly translated in this English rendering. But you got the idea.
My Guruji Khaptad Baba used to say, there are two types of seekers: the pig types and the swan types.</description>
