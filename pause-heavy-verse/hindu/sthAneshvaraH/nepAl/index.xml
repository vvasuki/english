      <description>Dhading Besi
I wake up sometimes,
With my feet pulsating with thrill,
Of jumping through the fields of Thopal.
Some childhood memories stick by,
Glued to our body, mingled with the soul.
Chasing after the kites,
Rolling down the fields,
Gliding along paper planes,
Jumping in the cold waters of Thopal.
It feels as if the red dust from the slopes,
Is still stuck to my body.
And the nameless shadows,</description>

      <description>Some childhood memories latch on
Adhered to the body
Imprinted on the soul
Chasing after the kites
Rolling down the fields
Soaring alongside paper planes
Jumping in the brisk waters of Thopal
It feels as if the red dust from the slopes
still clings to my skin
The nameless shadows
The faceless memories
The childrenâ€™s shrills of excitement
Remembering all the wild berries
Amla, Amaro, and Tindu fruits
Now feeling as though this life is but a shadow</description>

      <description>HOME
Peeping through the window at dawn,
I seek the aurora wrapping the peaks of Annapurna,
Adorned with the footsteps of Shiva,
In the first radiance of the day.
Morning chorus of drongo birds,
And some echos of temple bells,
Still evoke the sense of home,
Nothing but some scars of time.
The white silver turning gold,
With the sun reaching sunset hills,
Unleashing horses for some water,
Before resigning for the day.</description>

      <description>Mango Grove
They each had their names,
The mango trees that I climbed,
Asare, Jhutre, and Kali,
Parpane, Lohore, and Pharse.+++(5)+++
Waited for seasons to change,
To visit the villa of my sister,
By the banks of Trishuli,
To greet these mango trees.
Sometimes my sister asks,
If I am coming this season,
For mangos are ripe again,
Trishuli is still singing,
In the melody of Cuckoo birds,
The grove is still loaded,</description>

      <description>The House
He said he would build a house,
I could not say no.
He dragged his old body,
And devised his own methods,
With eight chambers and nine windows,
One day he asked, why was I not there,
To celebrate the house,
To belong somewhere,
And to scream,
With my arms spread,
This is mine!
But there were no flights,
He wished to see me before leaving,
And the next day he left.</description>

      <description>In the dry air of San Diego,
And the bright sunlight,
On top of Iron Mountain,
In the songs of mockingbirds.
I smell humidity today,
With storms gathered around,
Tall shadows of snowy peaks,
Reflecting the cuckoo songs.
The banks of Kali summon me again,
The footsteps left behind even before I knew shame,
Like a kite anchored away,
Magnetic force pulls me again.
Far gone are the childhood friends,</description>
