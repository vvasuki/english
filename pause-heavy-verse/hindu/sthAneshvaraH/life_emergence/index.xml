      <description>When turned into butterfly,
Grew just a single wing.
Could neither crawl nor fly.
The nestling,
Flopped her wings,
Peeped outside of the tiny nest,
And snuggled back.
The gypsy,
Gave him the ultimatum,
That she would leave him,
And kissed him deep.</description>

      <description>There is a gap
Between my emptiness and that of the Buddha
And all that exists,
Lies in between.</description>

      <description>Happy Holi:
May the color of madness,
That dyed Mira Bai red,
Color your shawl,
And drive you crazy,
In the craziness of Bama Khepa,
May you regain your madness again!</description>

      <description>Meaningful Life
I do not know when,
I found meaning to life,
And gave meaning to pointless things,
Forgetting all meanings were self-imposed.
And stopped fluttering like a butterfly,
In the garden of paradise,
And dragged the cart of success,
And made myself a meaningful ox,
I long for those meaningless days,
Those pointless laughters,
And a few drops of tears,
Not to make any point,
But just to live again,</description>

      <description>Nirvana
Sky covered with musky dust,
Slowly enveloping dusk,
Birds sheltered in the bamboo bush,
Singing the final songs of the day,
I gazed all the horizons,
In quest for the shadow,
That stole some strings of my heart.
My gaze in the empty sky,
Echoes the lost melancholies,
And Kama suspends his amorous play,
In the roars of the clouds,
Or the dazzles of the thunder,
As I search thy name and form,</description>

      <description>I sat in lotus pose,
Closed my eyes,
Returned my gaze to my heart,
And became one with the universe.
And the ants crawled over my body,
Termites swirled around my neck,
And a vulture thought I was dead.
When I woke up,
they were all gone.</description>

      <description>Search
Woke up with an urge to look for it,
And searched everywhere,
Inside and out,
Upstairs and downstairs,
And realized,
I had long forgotten what it was about.+++(5)+++
And they said they knew,
But I was not certain,
And some came and said it was nothing,
But I knew it was not nothing,
This veil through which,
I only see some shadows,
And know it is not nothing.+++(5)+++
And some came,</description>

      <description>Before turning it into flames,
Buddha watches his last desire,
The last lust,
And sees,
How desires overpowered him before,
And how feeble the desire had become now,
That it is begging to be there,
In a corner of his chest.
The beautiful daughter of death,
Spreads her bosom with hopes,
Not knowing,
The seed of passion that she thought,
Was actually the seed of compassion,
Now blossoming in her,</description>

      <description>Sunset
Inspire me! says Dirghatamas,
Gazing upon the setting sun,
In the world that he has not seen,
Having been born blind.
Seeing the world, a riddle,
A puzzle, more than a paradox,
We are our own riddle,+++(5)+++
Like the seer who was blind.
Staying awake in the dark,
And seeing darkness in the light,
He seeks to be inspired,
By the setting sun,
That never touched his eyes.+++(4)+++</description>

      <description>The Summit
It was a day hike,
Started before the sunrise,
When birds were singing the first Sama,
With first libation to their belly-fire.+++(5)+++
I crossed the same river many times,
Or may be different rivers once each,+++(5)+++
For the slopes were confusing,
Carved with countless hills.
It was a walk without a destination,
Aimless strolling,
And some friends showed me the summit,
That gave meaning to their hike.+++(5)+++
I made some friends and lost some,</description>

      <description>wait
As the sun pierces through the screen,
And caresses my skin,
Or the soothing moonbeam,
I realize,
All the great ones come to me.+++(5)+++
I would be long dead,
Had I to go find air to breathe,
Or even space and time.
Now my friend
I suspend my journey
In quest for the truth.
All the great ones come to me.</description>

      <description>Buddha wants me to wake up,
To the reality of emptiness and the emptiness of reality.
Shamkara screams to break my slumber,
To give me the realization,
Of my singularity.
It is just that my mother,
The dark and crazy one,
Keeps telling me,
Sleep my child, there is nothing for you to worry.+++(5)+++</description>

      <description>all dreams come to an end,
on the crack of the shell,
on the first opening,
the first sound,
as darkness vanished and light flooded,
I was both inside and outside the egg,
my feet inside and head outside,
touching the beauty of the first dawn,
I lingered with nostalgia,
with anxieties and pangs of emotions,
watching the vanishing shadows,
of those who tormented me in the dark,
ready for the first flight,</description>
