We all assume that teachers teach. This is self-given. But we all who teach know very well that we anticipate a clean whiteboard to start the class. I get so annoyed when some math teachers are too tired to clean the board. Teaching is a tender balance between spelling new scripts and erasing the old ones. Actually memory and forgetting are like two sides of the same coin of being.</description>

      <description>Lonely Palm
Every dawn and dusk,
He greets with shadow and light,
This lonely palm,
A sole witness of my days,
My being intertwined with his.
Some crows nested last year,
Doves hatched their nestlings this year,
The palm just is,
Indifferent,+++(5)+++
Lonely is the concept he lacks,+++(5)+++
Happy in the slumber of pure being.</description>

      <description>San Jacinto
Just because I have not seen you for a while,
Have not touched your outcrops,
Mixed my breath with yours,
And listened to the songs in your garden,
Do not think a minute goes by not thinking about you.
If not for this lockdown,
I would have grabbed my hiking stick,
And would have jumped up and down,
Your hills and valleys,
And birds would have followed me,</description>
