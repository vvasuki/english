      <description>Every night is the celebration of light,
As paradox is part of our being.
It is in the dark that we see the fire-flies glow,
Every drop counts in the desert.
When one darkness leads to another,
And death to another death,
And the night unfolds into a nightmare.
Hope is our company to shatter the chain.</description>

      <description>I say - let this be the last one,
Each time,
I say farewell to the sun and the breeze,
Something sprouts from deep within,
Each time something pulsates within.
No more I say and I still breathe,
No more I say and I still laugh,
I can never not be.</description>

      <description>edited life
looking for a beginning,
or some resolution,
to make sense of fleeting moments,+++(5)+++
pieced together,
some fern and mango leaves together,
some thrones and blossoms together,
edited some agonies,
cut out some nightmares,
to make life-narrative worth sharing.
do not ask me,
why the pieces do not match,
and are like broken shells,
crushed by the wheels of time.+++(4)+++
i will sing with you,
when find some songs worth sharing,</description>

      <description>Forgetting Forms as if vanish sometimes,
With just names in the heart,
Repeating after the beats,
Aching and agonizing beats,
Itching like the old scars.
And some enduring forms,
Vanishing forms with blurry names,
Fire crackles with intermittent flares,
Mind wonders to name the whisper,
The whisper of birth and of death.
Caught among the nameless feels,
Hooked in the memory of pain.
Like the footprints after a rain,
Unknowable something,</description>

      <description>I was told
not to walk on grass or move rocks
for they also had the right to be the way they were.
for my presence should not shadow their being.
I do not know
how to come out of silence
for words have been poisoned
the mouths that once chanted mantras
now ooze out blood.
I was told
I had the spells to heal the world.
this must be another world.</description>

      <description>Like a Samurai,
The last rose in the garden,
Kept fighting for survival,
To defy the wheel of time.
And with the last petal,
Gave me the last smile,
It stood up against scorching heat,
But gave up to a gentle breeze.
A fallen petal does not come back,
But there will be new buds when the season comes.</description>

      <description>Life
In the beginning was just night,
Enveloped by the thicket of dark,
A spark called life,
An ephemeral emanation.+++(5)+++
We crashed from nowhere,
Being in the middle of a saga,
Waking against a tempest,
In a sinking ship.+++(5)+++
Close our eyes to avoid monsters,
For shadows have us owned,
Flickering spark in the midst,
Confronts this mighty dark.
One last laugh,
One last sport,
One last gaze,
And shadows take over.</description>

      <description>When you pour like the hailstones,
Or pierce through the skin like the needles,
Or you burn like fire under the feet,
I find in you my only friend.
In my worst days of solitude,
And the days of tragedies.
You are the only one that I count on.
You caressed my body along the wind,
When I counted stars with the street dogs,
When the world shattered and broke,</description>

      <description>The palm tree greeted farewell to the setting sun,
Standing on the hilltop,
Just like it welcomed the rising sun.
The palm tree did not greet farewell to the sun,
Neither did the sun come and go.</description>

      <description>The Stranger
Every knock on the door,
Wakes me up,
Disrupting slumber,
Forcing me to peep through the window,
Reluctant to open the door.
Tik, tik, tik,
Comes the knock again,
Chilling the spine,
But nothing is there except for darkness,
Just darkness swallowed into darkness,
Kalidasa tries to pierce through darkness,
I just throw a rock and go back to bed,
No dreams other than the knocks,
For every pulsation becomes the beats,</description>

      <description>The Sunrise Remember the days when we would run out to the new sun every morning and sing with birds and run with the wind?
I am not talking about you but about those who were born before the machine age.
In those days kids were allowed to have a life and our growth was not measured on the equations we could solve.
When I walked out to the sun this morning,</description>

      <description>When I am alone,
I am with time.
It is just like sitting in the cremation ground.
Time confronts speech,
speech confronts time.
And they both will be there when I am long gone.</description>

      <description>Warrior,
You can rest sometimes, you know.
And think once for a change,
If the fight was yours,
Or was the one given to you.
I honor your heart, if not the fight,
For the noble cause you thought the fight was for.
From the left and the right,
You thought your fears were real worth fighting for.
Buddha would have said, I think,
The left is what makes the right,</description>

      <description>Wind Chimes
Last few days have been windy,
And the chimes are singing,
Stirring emotions from beneath surface,
Seeking any form to erupt out.
They chime melancholiness,
With a surge of momentariness,
Pushing me sometimes in between,
My waking and dreaming states.
Directionless wind, seeking its voice,
Assembles in my mind,
And the wavering sounds,
Probe my heart for pangs,
Where echos form the empty ground.</description>
