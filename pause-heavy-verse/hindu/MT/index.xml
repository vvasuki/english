On the path of nothingness we returned;
before us stood the bright prajApati,
with rudra’s bright dart pinning him to the welkin+++(=sky)+++.
In one hand we held an iron trident,
in the other we held a skull.
Beyond the carcass of prajapati
shone his wain+++(=carriage)+++, with the ruddy gem in it struck.
Further ahead shone the six mothers,
of our patron god with the spear.
Around us stood the city’s denizens.</description>

What is it that lies hidden in you they spot?
Why is it that they call you Devang Gandhi when you were VVS Laxman?
Why is it that you are a hero of the Ranji pitch but deliver no more than an egg at the real Test grounds?
Why is it that you smash a Karthik outside the ground, but get out on the first ball to Warnie?</description>

I am indra,
I made divodAsa triumph over his foes.
I handed over the vItahavyas to pratardana,
I gave sumitra a 1000 rods to slay dirghajihvI of a 1000 orifices.
I am indra,
the drinker of soma, without limit.
In the sumada of soma I slew namuchi with my vajra concealed in foam.
I am Indra,
the brahman known by R^ishis, the entire universe.
I slew kAlaka~njas, I crushed the paulomas and expelled them from existence.</description>

Males get to enjoy this wonderful steroid. The poets of the long past days may have called it loosener of kAma’s shara-s. It creates mathematical prowess where none existed previously and quickens activity like no other secretion. The mind starts conceiving what was previously unthinkable. It is on account of this that males get more violent, more innovative, and at times downright brilliant.
When it was not there I could not multiply two matrices,</description>

Sometimes a man goes to place so much better than where he stays or usually operates
that he gets a glimpse of the belief in the existence of higher loka-s or svarga-s.
As he wanders around that place,
he witnesses an abundance of things that so rare in his own
and has an intensity of experience much stronger than in his own.
Most denizens of that place have their own higher lives</description>
