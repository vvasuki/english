      <description>When the Buddha was creating the animals,
he forgot to give the bull and the camel their balls.
When the bull came to demand his balls
the Buddha had to make some out of left over scraps,
and gave him a pair of a sort.
This is why they look as if they have been patched together.
Then the camel came to get his balls,
and was offered some small left-over ones.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, the Mongols were giving the names of the animals to the twelve years of the calendar. They had allotted the names of eleven animals, and were won- dering what name to give to the very first year, when the camel and the rat began to quarrel as to whose name should be included. In order that neither of them should feel affronted, the TathƒÅgata appeared and told them to decide for themselves.</description>
