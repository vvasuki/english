      <description>My father-in-law had often mentioned that his father (Baba ji) had prevented him from going to the US for further studies. Born in a village in western UP named Fazalpur (later changed to Sundar Nagar) in pre-Independence India, he worked hard and eventually graduated from IIT Roorkee and became the first engineer from the village. When he secured acceptance in a university in the US, his excitement turned to dust because Baba ji would not hear of him leaving the village to never return just like another person who had left the village some years ago to study in the US.</description>
