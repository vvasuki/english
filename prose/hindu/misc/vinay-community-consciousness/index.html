<p>Paripoornam üåïü™∑‚òÄ- A Self Sustainable Community in India based on Natural Living, Natural Farming, Mud homes &amp; Natural Learning. Authentic Alternative School with academics mapped to real world life skills and activities, and health giving education because teachers inner work is such that healing and therapy is part of the curriculum. *Inspired by Waldorf, Gurukulam, J Krishnamurthy and Open Learning. We are 10 families now.</p>
<p>People from Urban space shifting to natural habitats and establishing cosmopolitan communities bring villages to community consciousness by reviving the local culture and making them self-sustainable, resilient to capitalism, decentralized and restoring <strong>True</strong> <strong>Freedom</strong>. This has to be done not out of fear but with the love and passion to live such life in practice which people can imitate and recreate.</p>
<p>This document is a humble effort from my end to awaken you to the truth through a story and selflessly help you and your family to shift to natural living.</p>

<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>After initiating the Paripoornamüåïü™∑‚òÄ, an</p>
<p>endeavor to establish a self-sustainable community, the first invitation message was circulated, which quickly gained traction. The message spread rapidly, reaching friends, family, and various groups.</p>
<p>Astonishingly, the response surpassed expectations, with over 700+ families from India and around the world expressing keen interest in joining our community.</p>
<p>After engaging in extensive discussions with these families and delving into their life experiences, I unearthed insights often obscured from mainstream view. Our perceptions have been clouded by the</p>
<p>influence of modern education, advertisements, and the deceptive allure of terms like &ldquo;development&rdquo; and</p>
<p>&ldquo;progress.&rdquo; Additionally, media outlets, movies, and social platforms perpetuate these illusions, while financial burdens such as home loans, car loans, and EMIs keep individuals shackled in a cycle of survival.</p>
<p>Furthermore, societal divisions based on caste, creed, religion, and color serve to perpetuate discord and inequality. And further by feeding contaminated water, air and adulterated food which makes us weak and takes away our capability to see through and seek freedom etc.</p>
<p>Always on the creative side, I opted to convey</p>
<p>factual information through storytelling rather than straightforward exposition. Additionally, I ensured to provide links for scientific validation of the claims made by individuals. I hope you enjoy this story and find it inspiring.</p>
<p>Caution : I have done my best to verify the information provided by people but I will not personally be responsible for any claims made in this document.</p>
<p>I do not take credit for any of my work, as I</p>
<p>consider myself merely an instrument. Everything you read or see is a reflection of what already exists within you. Nothing entirely new has been created here; rather, I have earnestly followed the instructions of the divine to ensure that we are in harmony and can collaborate as friends within a circle.</p>

<h2 id="feeding-the-devil">Feeding the Devil</h2>
<p>We are good people !!</p>
<p>but we are making only one mistake</p>
<p><strong>Chapter One: Lalitha - The Child of God</strong> Himanshu leads a comfortable life in the city</p>
<p>with his wife, Janani. They made the choice not to have children, perhaps due to their frequent travels.</p>
<p>Their neighbors, the Byre Gowda family, have three children - two boys and a girl. Meanwhile, Madhavan and his wife, Rukmini, are delighted with twins, a boy and a girl. Whenever the Himanshu family is away, the Byre Gowda used take care of their dog, Rumi, who happens to be a beloved friend of their youngest daughter, Lalitha.</p>
<p>Himanshu and Janani always treasured the</p>
<p>company of the Byre Gowda and Madhavan families.</p>
<p>Every Sunday, they gathered for lunch at Himanshu&rsquo;s house. Janani was known for her incredibly delicious biryani. While all the children relished the meal, Madhavan, being a vegan, wasn&rsquo;t particularly fond of their food. So, Janani would prepare a separate version of biryani just for him, free from any ghee.</p>
<p>During lunch, Byre Gowda often broached the subject with a hint of frustration, questioning why Himanshu and Janani hadn&rsquo;t had children. &ldquo;You two are so wonderful; you&rsquo;d make excellent parents,&rdquo; he would remark. Janani would chuckle in response, replying, &ldquo;Your children are like our own.&rdquo; However, deep down, they harbored a different sentiment.</p>
<p>Prior to embracing communal living, all three</p>
<p>families resided in a gated community, each in their independent homes with a small garden in front.</p>
<p>Before that chapter, they all lived on the same floor of an apartment building.</p>
<p>Himanshu and Janani had just tied the knot</p>
<p>when they first encountered the Byre Gowda family as their neighbors in an apartment building. Back then, Lalitha, the youngest daughter of the Byre Gowdas, was merely three years old. She was an adorable child, extremely sociable, often darting between their homes.</p>
<p>As a result, both households kept their doors open.</p>
<p>Rumi and Lalitha shared a fondness for each other,</p>
<p>known for their routine of morning, afternoon, and evening play sessions.</p>
<p>One day, Lalitha seemed unusually subdued,</p>
<p>devoid of her usual enthusiasm for play. She remained stationary, shedding tears without apparent cause, leaving her parents feeling utterly helpless. Concerned, they rushed her to the hospital, where numerous tests were conducted. Yet, to their dismay, all reports indicated she was perfectly healthy. As days turned into weeks, and her despondency persisted, her parents'</p>
<p>anxiety only deepened.</p>
<p>Throughout this trying time, Rumi remained</p>
<p>faithfully by her side, offering silent comfort. Despite their</p>
<p>efforts,</p>
<p>Lalitha&rsquo;s</p>
<p>condition</p>
<p>showed</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>improvement. Despite consultations with numerous doctors and psychologists, no definitive diagnosis emerged. Her speech dwindled, often repeating the same words or lines of a song in a continuous loop.</p>
<p>Janani and Himanshu, grappling with despair, exhausted every possible avenue in their quest for answers. They sought solace in spiritual practices, visiting temples and seeking the guidance of tantric practitioners. They adhered to the advice of Lalitha&rsquo;s grandparents and sought the expertise of top Ayurvedic and homeopathic doctors. In their desperation, they even visited churches and mosques, praying fervently for a miracle. Yet, despite their unwavering efforts, Lalitha&rsquo;s condition only worsened.</p>
<p>**Chapter Two: How deep is the rabbit hole? **</p>
<p>Madhavan, an Artificial Intelligence researcher and a dedicated investigator, delved into the history of Lalitha&rsquo;s symptoms, meticulously examining every hour of the preceding week. After exhaustive analysis, he reached a startling conclusion: Lalitha&rsquo;s condition seemed to manifest shortly after vaccination. Sensing a potential link, he embarked on a quest to explore the correlation between vaccines and developmental</p>
<p>disorders.</p>
<p>Contacting numerous parents of autistic children, Madhavan discovered a recurring pattern: many</p>
<p>observed a connection between vaccinations and the onset of autism spectrum disorders and other</p>
<p>developmental delays. One family, deeply entrenched in research due to their own 12-year-old son&rsquo;s autism spectrum diagnosis, shared invaluable insights with Madhavan. They revealed a surprising discovery: in cases where children exhibited hyperactivity and were diagnosed with ADHD, testing their hair for lead heavy</p>
<p>metal often yielded significant results, proving to be true in three out of three cases#2.</p>
<p>Madhavan recalled the controversy surrounding</p>
<p>Maggie#1, which faced a ban due to excessive lead content. He couldn&rsquo;t comprehend why any amount of lead would be permitted in our food. Who determined these permissible levels, he wondered? The irony struck him: despite its toxicity, trace amounts of lead are ubiquitous in factory-made foods. It seemed that, bit by bit, the lake of contamination was being filled.</p>
<p>He considered a seemingly straightforward</p>
<p>solution: avoiding all packaged food items. A sense of relief washed over him at the thought. However, his relief was short-lived. Just recently, he had come across news highlighting the high levels of heavy metals found in vegetables and fruits sold within the city#1.</p>
<p>Madhavan grappled with a pressing question: why weren&rsquo;t all children affected by vaccines, given their widespread usage across the globe? Seeking answers, he encountered a parent who, alongside being a</p>
<p>dedicated doctor, had devoted her life to caring for her two autistic children. She offered a scientific explanation for this perplexing phenomenon.</p>
<p>Dr. Sreelatha (MBBS, MD) said, Our mouth is</p>
<p>the Gatekeeper and it guards everything coming into our body and it will make sure the toxins are flushed out if they enter through the mouth by sending right information to our brain which instructs the organs responsible for flushing it out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s essential to eat slowly and chew food until it becomes like juice. Another benefit of taking time and chewing slowly is that it allows the brain to fully comprehend the nutritional content of the food and prepares the digestive system to absorb it fully. Nowadays, children are often rushed through meals just to avoid being late for school. However, growing children truly need ample time to finish their</p>
<p>breakfast and meals. It&rsquo;s a disservice we&rsquo;re doing to our children.</p>
<p>Sending children to mainstream schools might be one of the biggest mistakes in human history. For millions of years, humans lived without modern</p>
<p>schools, we had our indigenous ways of educating them. The modern schools which only began around 200 years ago during the industrial era have been accepted as normal!. These schools were designed to produce workers who would follow orders, taking away their ability to think independently. Like sheep, children are grouped by age and confined within four walls, almost like a prison. There isn&rsquo;t much difference between a prison and a modern school. Meal times should be peaceful and spent with loved ones in a comfortable setting. If you and your children cannot enjoy 30 minutes of calm during each meal, then it‚Äôs a sign of a truly unsuccessful life. This, to me, is real poverty.</p>
<p>When we inject something, we bypass this security system. In humans and animals, nature has designed a first line of defense, affected first so that as a species, we can make course corrections and build herd immunity. It&rsquo;s for this reason that children with weak immunity are affected first (the BSF of</p>
<p>humans). Most children are unaffected because they possess a body capable of flushing out toxins.</p>
<p>However, children whose bodies cannot fully expel toxins may experience various ailments.</p>
<p>Toxins don&rsquo;t necessarily come from vaccines; they can enter our bodies through various sources such as biscuits, factory-made foods, chemically grown</p>
<p>vegetables, pesticides sprayed on fruits, food grown in fields treated with weedicide (a practice followed by almost 99% of farmers), paint on walls, pencils, chemically made crayons, soaps, shampoos, lipsticks, polyester clothing, junk food from fast-food chains like KFC and McDonald&rsquo;s, food stored in plastic containers, and the water we drink.</p>
<p>The very food we eat has been engineered to</p>
<p>make it addictive through various means of chemicals.</p>
<p>Did you know that the cigarette manufacturing companies acquired big food manufacturing companies and put their scientists to recreate addiction science from cigarettes to food! #09 And lobbied government agencies and research institutes to make policies and publish research to downplay the ill effect of sugar. If people truly understood what sugar does to them it would have been banned a long time ago. It‚Äôs high time people realize that the government is not here to protect the people but to exploit them. It doesn‚Äôt matter which political party.</p>
<p>Special needs children are very sensitive to what is not healthy. By observing them we should avoid such things so that it does not damage us in the long run. For example special needs children show</p>
<p>immediate reaction in their health if they eat food made from Genetically Modified farm produce. For normal children the reaction may go unnoticed like they may just have constipation for a day or two etc.</p>
<p>Special needs children have difficulty in sleeping if led light or not, wifi, bluetooth radiation. Now there is almost no escape from 4G and 5G radiation. Notice that cancer patients increased a lot after the</p>
<p>introduction of 5G#9. Instead of relying on some research paper just observe yourself how will be your mental status when you are in a 5G umbrella and when you go a bit outskirt and you will also feel liberated when you are completely away from it like 200km away from metro cities. Special needs children are also very sensitive to loud sounds, chemicals, sounds from electric appliances like refrigerators, people quarreling, people who are not at peace can‚Äôt we around them. What does all these tell you?. These souls took the path of suffering to tell us that it‚Äôs not normal. Because millions of people are committing errors assuming it&rsquo;s normal, it does not become right.</p>
<p>Only the brave can stand up and live rightly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pervasive, isn&rsquo;t it? The only solution seems to be immersing ourselves in a natural environment for as long as possible. She concluded her observation with a heavy heart, mentioning that she stopped practicing because she felt guilty about it.</p>
<p>Dr. Sreelatha continued to express her concern, emphasizing the urgency of finding a solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madhavan, we must act quickly,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;because now 1 out of 36 children#4 are on the autistic spectrum, and 1 out of 10 people are going to suffer from cancer according to WHO#3. The trajectory mankind is on will lead to its own demise.</p>
<p>The urban system, built on exploitation over the past 200 years, is teetering on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>Its downfall is inevitable as it&rsquo;s not even 5%</p>
<p>sustainable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to sell everything we have here and invest in a better life by shifting to a natural habitat together, living as a community,&rdquo; she urgently proposed. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t act now, we risk losing everything or being trapped in our city homes by another engineered pandemic, a &lsquo;plandemic.&rsquo; This is a battle we must face together, or they will soon make it illegal to grow our own food#7. &quot; Madhavan could sense the desperation and helplessness in her words.</p>
<p>Madhavan delved deeper into his research and uncovered unsettling truths about industrial dairy practices. Cows endure the injection of insane amounts of vaccines and growth hormones, confined to cramped spaces, subjected to relentless exploitation under the control of capitalists. The violence inflicted upon animals before their meat reaches our tables became unbearable to him. Similarly, in industrial egg production, chickens are confined to tiny 2x2 spaces for their entire lives, kept alive through extensive medication.</p>
<p>In his investigation of more than 2 years,</p>
<p>Madhavan unearthed alarming evidence suggesting that boys&rsquo; bodies are feminizing due to unexpected breast growth, signaling a looming gender crisis. This phenomenon, he discovered, is directly linked to the consumption of eggs and industrial meat#8.</p>
<p>Driven by a quest for healthier alternatives,</p>
<p>Madhavan sought out authentic organic grains, pulses, vegetables, and fruits, only to realize the near</p>
<p>impossibility of finding organic food in the city. His disappointment grew as he discovered that many</p>
<p>popular brands offering organic food were engaged in fraudulent practices.</p>
<p>The most shocking revelation for Madhavan was</p>
<p>regarding RO water. He realized that this seemingly essential drinking water had become the main culprit behind numerous diseases. He felt a wave of guilt knowing that his children had been drinking the same water since birth, which likely explained the various health issues they faced. Madhavan discovered that RO</p>
<p>water was responsible for deficiencies in vitamins D</p>
<p>and B12#5, directly impacting gut health. Furthermore, it leached essential minerals from the body, leading to diseases such as osteoporosis, arthritis, depression, mood swings, irritability, bone loss, hair loss, diabetes, fatigue, cramps, insomnia, hypertension, and heart disease#5.</p>
<p>How did we become so thoroughly brainwashed</p>
<p>that well water, known as living water due to its microbial content and charged by the sun and moon,</p>
<p>is considered unsafe, while dead water from RO</p>
<p>systems is deemed safe? If the microbes in well water truly caused diseases, our ancestors would never have survived, considering RO technology has only been around for a few decades. Interestingly, in the same timeframe as RO&rsquo;s emergence, we&rsquo;ve seen a surge in health issues.</p>
<p>The deeper he delved into the rabbit hole, the</p>
<p>more shocking revelations unfolded before him, leaving him astounded. His background as an AI researcher proved invaluable as he uncovered layers of truth that were difficult to digest. It felt as though we were all mere sheep, blindly following the herd and being led to slaughter, not just once but over an extended period of time. It was a grim realization of self-accepted slavery, a downward spiral from which it seemed nearly impossible for people to escape. He recognized it as a Chakravyuha, intricately crafted by capitalists, trapping humanity in a relentless cycle of exploitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my god, the destruction we&rsquo;re causing in the name of development and progress!&rdquo; Madhavan exclaimed, overwhelmed by the magnitude of the</p>
<p>realization. He understood that the more we immerse ourselves in city life, the more we inadvertently fuel destruction.</p>
<p>Attempting to convey his concerns to his friends Himanshu and Byregowda, Madhavan faced resistance from Himanshu, who dismissed it as nonsense.</p>
<p>However, what truly shocked Madhavan was</p>
<p>Byregowda&rsquo;s unexpected awareness of these issues, and even more.</p>
<p>Byregowda, an excellent photographer working for a news channel, shared his perspective with Madhavan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madhavan, my parents made the mistake of leaving the village and coming to the city. Whether they did so voluntarily, seeking a better future, or were coerced by those seeking control, the outcome is the same. We find ourselves here, feeling utterly helpless. There&rsquo;s nothing we can do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued, expressing their collective ignorance of farming and food cultivation. &ldquo;Can we simply buy a farm and become farmers? We don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>whether rice grows on plants or trees. We lack the basic knowledge needed to grow our own food. We&rsquo;re like lab rats, trapped in a system with no means of escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something that will shock you even more,&rdquo; Byregowda continued. &ldquo;The education system itself is designed to brainwash us and our children into becoming lifelong slaves. Despite being highly</p>
<p>educated, I diligently set reminders in my calendar for my children&rsquo;s vaccination appointments, unwittingly perpetuating the cycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Education made me believe it&rsquo;s safe,&rdquo; Byregowda confessed with a heavy heart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 100% sure Lalitha became autistic only after vaccination. I opted for the best, painless, and high-priced vaccine for my child.</p>
<p>What an idiot I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You know the so-called visionaries and tech giants don&rsquo;t allow their own children to use their own products or services. Steve Jobs never let his kids use an iPad. Today Byjus (controlled by Meta)</p>
<p>brainwashed every parent to buy their online media based lessons which is making the children more stupid. Parents dumping their children down. Do you remember the ads run by this evil corporation called WhiteHat Jr where children are their customer!. Such early age children are exposed to computers, phones, addictive Youtube, tiktok videos, mindless games. I guess you already know what PubG kind of games</p>
<p>have done to our children.</p>
<p>You know they don&rsquo;t give loans to purchase farm land but they run behind you to give your plot loan, home loan. They want to keep us in the city till we die and make sure knowingly or unknowingly work for them. We pay emi to something which doesn&rsquo;t have any value. Everything has to be purchased here.</p>
<p>Nothing can be grown here, on the contrary everything can be grown in a farm and live a sustainable life without the worry of emis.</p>
<p>Only an educated person can live an unnatural, unhealthy life. Highly educated people like you become a vegan but can you convince an old farmer in a remote village to stop using ghee or eating country chicken eggs? They have free range country chickens which take 6 to 8 months to be ready for</p>
<p>consumption. All health issues started after some greedy educated people started advertising to other educated people that seed oil is best for health.</p>
<p>My sister Devi, who resides in the US, tried a</p>
<p>vegan diet for a year. Recently, she started developing small lumps in her hands and began to suffer from arthritis. When she consulted doctors, they suggested she might be lactose intolerant and advised her to avoid dairy. She explained that she was already vegan!</p>
<p>One Chinese doctor requested a list of everything she had eaten in the last month. Upon review, he noticed that she consumed a lot of tofu daily for protein. He advised her to stop eating tofu. Within one month, the lumps disappeared, and all arthritis</p>
<p>symptoms healed. It&rsquo;s very difficult to find non-GMO</p>
<p>produce. Devi made a U-turn from veganism.</p>
<p>Someone called Jinan KB#6 who spent more than 3 decades with tribes used to say <strong>‚ÄúLiterates know</strong> <strong>the word and illiterates know the world.‚Äú</strong></p>
<p>Byregowda repeated, we are helpless and we have no option other than to suffer like this. But if we can collectively make an effort to shift to a natural habitat then I&rsquo;m ready to sell whatever I got and ready to shift. But what about children&rsquo;s education? How do we grow food? We don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>Madhavan, Byregowda and mahadev all started</p>
<p>thinking if anything can be done. Will owning a farm land will solve the problem? Is there something that can be done to give better education to our children?</p>
<p>Are there more people who realized all these, how to reach them so that we could work together ?</p>
<p>They are now awake and looking for an exit option.</p>
<p>Not just an exit option but the</p>
<p>**TRUE FREEDOM. **</p>
<p>And there are people who still wish to live in this illusion!</p>
<p><strong>Chapter Three: The Tribes and Wild Dogs</strong> Hariharan, the father of Madhavan, is one of the key people in his village. Madhavans parents are almost 70 years old but they look a lot younger and fit as well. Hariharan would not leave home without vibhuti on his forehead. His attire is always a white shirt and white panache (a kind of dhoti). Whenever villagers had trouble they would turn to Hariharan. He resolved one of the tricky problems of the village right before moving to his son&rsquo;s apartment in the city. He dealt with a pack of wild dogs menace who were</p>
<p>attacking the livestock in his and neighbouring village.</p>
<p>These dogs were very clever and vicious and lived in the nearby forest. Sometimes villager would tie their cows in the grass field away from the village to graze and they go on with their other work. This pack of wild dogs would identify the unattended cows and prey on them. By the time villagers came to Hariharn to seek his help, the dogs had already killed 2 cows and 4 calves. Villagers had kept the locally made poison from a tree called Mustichakka mixed with chicken meat which is the usual solution. But somehow these dogs didn‚Äôt fall into this trap. They approached the</p>
<p>forest officials but they informed them that dogs don‚Äôt fall into their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Hariharan, who had a very good relationship with the tribes, had helped them in their legal battle with the government. Democratically elected government legally removed the tribes from their natural habitat stating that they are a danger to the wild animals because they hunt them.</p>
<p>Forest land was declared as reserved forest and the government claimed it as theirs. A bill was passed that no humans are allowed to live in the reserved forests. Overnight, tribes have been removed forcefully from the forest where they lived for generations. They were forced to work as laborers for their livelihood.</p>
<p>Tribes were misused, and abused by so-called educated people in city. Hariharan had a friend who was a lawyer and he fought the case on behalf of tribes for their rights. Tribes claimed that the forest belongs to them and they are the protectors of the forest.</p>
<p>The tribe&rsquo;s leader argued that we&rsquo;ve inhabited this land long before your government came into existence.</p>
<p>Our ancestors have dwelled here since ancient times, even preceding the reign of kings. We adhere to the laws of nature. You, the government, are outsiders to us. What gives you the right to claim ownership of the forest? You don&rsquo;t reside here. You sit hundreds or thousands of kilometers away and assert it as your property? When we lived in the forest, no one dared to cut a single tree.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;ve appointed a forest officer as the</p>
<p>guardian of the forest, someone who lacks any</p>
<p>emotional connection to the land. Their sole objective is to generate profit for themselves, as well as for government officials and politicians, often at the expense of forest destruction. Moreover, they and their colleagues subject our people to daily abuse.</p>
<p>Why not appoint our tribe people as forest</p>
<p>officers and appoint one educated clerk to write to you people?</p>
<p>Indeed, we hunt for our livelihood, much like a tiger or lion hunts for its sustenance. Our hunting isn&rsquo;t for pleasure, but for survival itself. As you&rsquo;ve shifted away from a natural way of life to inhabit an</p>
<p>artificially constructed world, why impose the same on us?</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt pollute or exploit nature, nor do we</p>
<p>mine, spray chemicals, relocate stones, or destroy mountains for construction. We abstain from building dams or selling water, relocating villages for</p>
<p>development, or imposing labor on others. Medicine is freely given, devoid of the concept of money. Our homes are constructed from forest materials, returning to the earth eventually. Nothing enters from outside, and nothing leaves the forest. We protect every blade of grass.</p>
<p>Now, however, the designation of the forest as</p>
<p>reserved prevents grazing, reducing cattle numbers drastically. Cattle, crucial for dispersing seeds and enhancing forest diversity, are now scarce. The absence of organic manure forces the use of costly</p>
<p>chemical</p>
<p>fertilizers,</p>
<p>burdening the community</p>
<p>financially. Loans, imposed upon them, tragically lead to suicide.</p>
<p>Besides all the valid arguments the court ruled against the people and as compensation something called colony houses made of concrete were allocated to them in some distant places.</p>
<p>When Hariharn reached out to tribes to seek help in tracking the wild dogs and hunting them they happily agreed. A group of 5 men, 3 women and 4</p>
<p>children stayed in Hariharn‚Äôs village temple for a few days and started to track the dogs. After a few days of observation, the leader of the group informed Hariharan that there was no need to hunt all the dogs. We only have to hunt the leader. The pack is led by the vicious one and hunting him will break the pack and we can catch the rest and domesticate</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>After learning their whereabouts, a clear plan was laid out and the plan was executed. The arrow pierced through the heart of the dog and while it took its last breath the tribes offered water to its mouth and prayed for its soul. The rest of the dogs were</p>
<p>scattered and eventually were caught and then trained as per their need. The Wild Dogs which were once a nightmare to villagers are now guarding their livestock.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter Four: The Root Cause</strong> Hariharan and his wife Lakshmi who lived freely in their village all their life now suffocated in urban space. After the bank confiscated their home and land, they had left with no choice other than relocating to their sons apartment in city. They are feeling lonely because they are now disconnected from their</p>
<p>relatives, friends, and their land. They are helplessly carving to go back to their village.</p>
<p>Now Hariharn regrets sending his only son</p>
<p>Madhavan to school. Hariharan says to his wife</p>
<p>Lakshmi, If our son didn‚Äôt become educated then he wouldn‚Äôt need to come to this hell to make a living. I pledged all our ancestor&rsquo;s land for his higher education to go to another country. In pursuit of unknown hell, we lost the Heaven. What is the use of this apartment where nothing can be grown here? Everything has to come from outside and we have to pay money for it!</p>
<p>Even for water! Do you still remember the horror of COVID-19? How they locked everyone in their home, no one could move out of the city!.</p>
<p>They made people pay lakhs together money for the Air. My son said we have to get vaccinated if we wish to live in this gated community. What rule is that !!, didn‚Äôt we instantly refused but later our own children made us take it. Made us wear masks</p>
<p>forcefully !. How can anyone let someone inject something into their body, that is made by only god knows who?</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>our</p>
<p>village,</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>had</p>
<p>our</p>
<p>Vaidhya</p>
<p>Shanbulingayya, we grew up with him. His father used to treat our villagers and even neighbors, but never asked for money but villagers have always paid him in abundance. Remember you always used to keep one share of butter for their family. He learnt to practice from his father. We have absolute trust in him. Every full moon day he would remind the whole village to drink castor oil to deworm themselves. He would just hold our hand for a few seconds and used to tell us precisely what the problem was and make medicine for us.</p>
<p>How blindly these people in the city are trusting someone without even knowing! I think these people have lost the capability to think for themselves. Like sheeps they follow what they have been told in the media and brainwashed by their politicians and</p>
<p>impetuously accept their government policies. Isn‚Äôt we all of different caste lived in harmony in our village!, why is there so much polarity only here in city, and this hatred is spreading to villages also. After people started becoming zombies on their phone it started to spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>I repeatedly told them not to take covid19</p>
<p>vaccine to my son and my daughter-in-law but they said they didn‚Äôt have any option as they had to show the certificate to their company. In my observation, they are not the same anymore. The vitality they had before is weaned off now. People started to fall like apples after the vaccine drive. There must be some connection. We lost the land and home and now I am worried, if something happens to our son who will take care of our grandchildren?. What kind of company takes people&rsquo;s freedom? Is it worth working for such a</p>
<p>company? Both Son and Daughter-in-law have to work like donkeys to make a living</p>
<p>in this urban hell!.</p>
<p>I used to work only one season in the fields,</p>
<p>another six months of complete rest, and joyful living with friends and relatives, the celebrations, wow what a life we had. Isn‚Äôt that is how humans should live, isn‚Äôt it ? A relaxed life without worries ?</p>
<p>Modern education took all that away exclaimed</p>
<p>Hariharn saying it to his wife. His wife had many things to say but simply nodded her head. You know what Lakshmi; ‚ÄúCity i a dirty place run by corrupt people for greedy humans, few good people are trapped in it‚Äù. Just see for any guests to visit us they are being treated like criminals by taking their contact, photos, signature!. How a fellow human can not trust their own kind !. The same people who treat other fellow humans like criminals become very friendly and become good at the movement they enter the village.</p>
<p>I wonder if it‚Äôs the people or the place. If it‚Äôs place then I think cities is cursed. Humans supposed to love</p>
<p>the company of other humans. Do you remember in our village for Yeksha Gaana (a from of art and dance) how we all used to come together. I am</p>
<p>missing</p>
<p>the festival</p>
<p>celebration of our harvests</p>
<p>(Sankranthi/Pongal). What a spectacular celebration the whole village used to have. The boundaries of my land were not there for the preparation for the sports of bulls. I always dreamed madhavan would participate in such a race but the more children became educated the less they participated. Educated people become spectators instead of experiencing it. I think something happens in this school which takes away their natural curiosity. Their only motivation to experience</p>
<p>something is only if some money is involved.</p>
<p>During the morning walk, I observed a home</p>
<p>construction, it generated garbage half of it‚Äôs height.</p>
<p>In our village we all together did the construction of our home. How beautiful it was. It was beautiful when just started, that beauty is only enhanced when half done. It becomes a temple after its completion. I am sure it will be beautiful when it is dismantled. Not a gram of waste was generated !. Built with what</p>
<p>mother earth gave using our bare hands and one day everything goes back to her gracefully. Inside our mud home at the village, I always felt like I was in the protected womb of my mother.</p>
<p>Hariharn continued, didn‚Äôt we keep two cows for our son?&rdquo; He grew up drinking those 2 mothers&rsquo; milk, he relished the butter and ghee. He says he has become a vegan now! What nonsense is this? How</p>
<p>can someone change their diet overnight ?. Isn‚Äôt our body a gift of our fathers and forefathers ? Isn‚Äôt it common sense that this gifted body is accustomed to certain types of food from generations?. What mistake our grandchildren have done to be deprived of the goodness of ghee. People in the city don&rsquo;t even know which cows milk they are consuming! such is their ignorance. Isn‚Äôt it true that one should drink the milk of the cow who accepted them as her own family ?</p>
<p>How people are living here without having cows around them!. Through Ganjala (cow urine) Mother Ganga has to fall on our land and consecrate the place everyday and fill the space with such vibes. It&rsquo;s so energetic to walk on the mud floor on which our cow</p>
<p>dung paste is applied. My father used to tell alway use lactating cow dung and urine. I still don‚Äôt know why he emphasized on it so much. May be because</p>
<p>goddess lakshmi resides in cow dung and ganga</p>
<p>resides in the gangala (cow urine). The very presence of cows and calves is so soothing. How beautiful it was to see the newly born calf. The</p>
<p>It used to run and jump and all the kids also ran behind it. Madhavan used to cuddle his cow for hours together , I hope he still has not forgotten the beautiful childhood he had. Lakshmi, I am sorry my ignorance dragged you to this life . I pray to god if there is a way to go back to our original life.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter Five: Brothers and Sister born to</strong> <strong>different mother</strong></p>
<p>Madhavan, Byregowda went on a quest and</p>
<p>started searching for answers. Himanshu joined their quest not because he believed in what they were awakened to but for their friendship. They found few alternative learning spaces who are making a</p>
<p>difference. There are few city bread people who shifted to farm life and living happily. They did talk to a few of such people but the answer they received is it&rsquo;s not sustainable because for every work they have to invest money. The conclusion they received is for the same money and effort they might as well purchase double of the produce in the market. Keeping one labor family to take care of itself is an overhead. How much one single family can work. It will be too exhausting. I think that&rsquo;s why many city people purchase the land, put in fences and leave the land barren, empty. They own the land in papers but land does not belong to them. They never forget to post some pics of them planting some trees in their farm on social media.</p>
<p>While they were exploring this they came across a community living where people are leaving a</p>
<p>fantastic life. It solved all the problems. They went home and started talking to their wife and tried to convince them to make a drastic change to their life.</p>
<p>Instantly they rejected such an idea. After taking them to many places and workshops, they were</p>
<p>convinced but still not ready yet. Even if they agree, some guidelines of the existing community would not match all their expectations. Some are too radical and some or too liberal. Roots to local culture were missing.</p>
<p>One fine day they receive a WhatsApp message</p>
<p>in multiple groups and also through friends forwards where one family who is much like them invites them to join together to establish a self sustainable community in their farm land. Instantly they spoke with the person called Partha and were convinced to join him. Partha agrees to talk to them together and address their issues which are stopping them from moving to natural life.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s surprising to Madhavan is that Partha has no Idea about all the ill effects of vaccines, someone controlling us, one world order etc.</p>
<p>Partha shared his perception, Let&rsquo;s say if all that you researched is true and you are running away from all that then your community is built out of fear.</p>
<p>Such community won‚Äôt last long. The community</p>
<p>should be built out of love and with passion to live a natural life. The community is truly established if different people accept each other as their own brother and sisters and works towards the betterment of the community. Partha remembered this verse from Rudalf Steiner</p>
<p>Working on yourself is more important to build a healthy community. I appreciate you and your family decision to shift to community life. Next process is first to address all your questions. Once you are convinced to join you have to prepare yourself to be in community. We need one common ground through</p>
<p>which we live a friction free life in our community. We all assimilated Madhyasth Darshan or ‚ÄòCoexistential Philosophy‚Äô - it‚Äôs an insight into reality &amp; human nature. We expect the same from new families who join us and we help you with it.</p>
<p>Anyways they all had a call together to address their wifes questions.</p>
<p><strong>The Questions</strong></p>
<p>So the questions start flooding, most of them</p>
<p>from their wifes and are not answered but a quest together to discuss and explore possible solutions acceptable to both.</p>
<h2 id="free-at-last">Free at Last</h2>
<p><strong>Chapter Six: The meeting, The Disappointment,</strong> <strong>Decisions that shapes our future</strong></p>
<p>Before making the final decision to join the</p>
<p>community all three families decided to meet Partha and family and also see the land where community is about to happen. Madhavans parents were more</p>
<p>excited than anyone else. Even though they are almost 70 years old, the age would not stop them from</p>
<p>traveling all the way to Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>They traveled in their 2 cars and reached the</p>
<p>destination after around 5 hours of travel. They were advised to book accommodation at a farm stay nearby and they did that promptly, stayed overnight and started again after having wholesome Spicy Andhra Organic Breakfast.</p>
<p>Morning Madhavan and Byregowda had high</p>
<p>expectations on meeting Partha. As they reached the village, Partha received them with a smile. His appearance was as ordinary as anyone else. Looks like he has not shaved in the last 2 weeks, wearing a T</p>
<p>Shirt and shorts looks odd for the person who came</p>
<p>up with an intuitive vision of a self sustainable community. In sameways Madhavan and Byregowda</p>
<p>were disappointed. As people from the car got down Partha recognized the elders and touched their feet seeking blessings. Madhavan&rsquo;s father could recognize something in him and hugged him as if he knew him from a long time. Madhavan was bit intrigued by this.</p>
<p>The children met other children and start to play as if they already know them and knows the place.</p>
<p><strong>The Beginning of Paripoornam</strong></p>
<p>After a few months of discussions they decided</p>
<p>to form a self sustainable community by joining hands with Partha and family.</p>
<p>Partha and family have</p>
<p>talked to 700+ families and met many of them then finally fennel it down to 10 families and 15 more to go before reaching its threshold. The families were scattered all over India and few families from outside India have also joined.</p>
<p>They started having a weekly meeting every</p>
<p>Saturday at 6pm. Some of them chose a teacher&rsquo;s role and started to attend Waldorf teachers training</p>
<p>program. A deep sense of commitment rose in everyone. Some families who primarily joined because of their children education took the challenge and their right questions in the community call bring the best out of us and eventually lead to a strong</p>
<p>pedagogy team. Pedagogy team become the holder of the space and because of this more and more families with children have joined.</p>
<p>Being aware that children education is taken care responsible and passionate teachers, the remaing parents could breath out and focues on other aspects of community.</p>
<p>Some were already trained in permaculture and</p>
<p>they started implementation of it. A Vernacular Architect reached out them and offered help in design and implementation. To reduce the cost they</p>
<p>announced it as a workshop which helped them to pay to the labours and raise funds for materials. Few volunteers joined and stared helping the community building. Meanwhile news families had multiple</p>
<p>discussion with other families and some have visited the persons home as well as farm. In parallel they</p>
<p>stared to search for a bigger parcel of the land for the community.</p>
<p>In between some families who didn&rsquo;t had the</p>
<p>courage left the community even before it started.</p>
<p>This didn&rsquo;t shatter the confidence of the community.</p>
<p>Many families who have no children approached</p>
<p>to be part of the collective but partha felt helpless as he couldn&rsquo;t do much for them but he didn&rsquo;t let them go but some genuine family who would bring some values have been taken into community even though they didn&rsquo;t have children but the bet paid well. The youth quota turned the stones and moved the</p>
<p>mountains. Some elders were also taken into the community considering their contribution to the pedagogy team.</p>
<p>1st year was a very challenging year and from</p>
<p>day one the community was not self sustainable.</p>
<p>There were many challenges but because of the</p>
<p>collective effort they were able to get through all the challenges joyfully. Community people used to</p>
<p>brainstorm and come up with creative solutions to challenges.</p>
<p>It once happened that Madhavan was not happy</p>
<p>with a few helpers drinking alcohol everyday. He would go to them and preach how bad drinking alcohol</p>
<p>affects their health. Initially they would nod their head but would drink anyways in hidden places or outside the community.</p>
<p>Byregowda gave a different solution. He offered them to make their own drink from the date</p>
<p>tree(palm tree). Now they don&rsquo;t get too high and have less impact on their health üòÇ.</p>
<p>Like this many challenges they sailed through in years. It was all worth. They all settled down with beautiful memories. They were proud of themselves because one&rsquo;s dream is to build a home and settle for good but these people built an entire village for themselves. What an achievement.</p>
<p>They recognized that if we had a fully developed farm with lots of fruit trees then life will be more wonderful and it gives at least 10 years of head start to the community and they pooled the money together and bought 10 acres of fully developed farm in</p>
<p>Karnataka which is surrounded with lush green and scenic views.</p>
<p>A potter family, a carpenter family, handloom</p>
<p>family, bee keepers, blacksmith families have joined the community. In the 2nd year they opened their school for outsiders. Many children from neighboring villages have joined. By this time the community was already famous around the world, thanks to the</p>
<p>marketing team of the community who did a fantastic job. People from all over the world started to visit the community. Many families have taken the admission for their children. Some members in the community started different ventures like sustainable construction, natural birthing, nature cure, organic stores which all started making a good amount of profit.</p>
<p>Children learnt to speak more than 5 languages which happened naturally because of the multilingual community structure. Thanks to the pedagogy team and the community children become capable of</p>
<p>learning anything on their own and capable of facing challenges in life. Most children made careers out of many ventures in the community. Some children</p>
<p>started new ventures with the help of the community.</p>
<p>Created more jobs which were occupied by other</p>
<p>children where the one who runs the company and the employee are all the same. Treated the same, also paid the same.</p>
<p>Children who joined the school from the village had a wonderful time. These children become very different. They would sing to their parents and parents were sometimes confused if they were sending children to learn academic subjects or singing, painting, handwork classes etc. What&rsquo;s more confusing to</p>
<p>parents was that these children used to sing songs in many languages which they don&rsquo;t know. Languages like telugu, kannada, Tamil, Hindi, English, Zambian, Marathi, Bengali, Assamese, Malayalam, Spanish in the</p>
<p>same way while the world is being covered. But children learnt to speak excellent English which gives the confirmation to parents from the village that they are in good hands. They started to spend more time with their parents helping them in their household work, cooking, and they started teaching the right way of farming to their parents. A good samskara has been given to children. In villages eye a true Gurukulam is established for which they carry the reverence. Villages could see the commitment that the people from the city came here and become part of their culture. The trust that the village is in safe hands has been established. Since there was no fee the villagers felt they were indebted to the school. They came and asked what they wanted. We told them we want</p>
<p>naturally grown grains, pulses, Vegetables and fruits.</p>
<p>Help in our farming activities. We approached them.</p>
<p>Can you take care of a few Desi cows which we wish to donate to you. Some families took the job to preserve seeds only. Some came and told the</p>
<p>community that they are experts in sustainable</p>
<p>construction learnt from their forefathers but it was lost and we can revive it back. A pottery who got to</p>
<p>know about us joined us with his family who have 3</p>
<p>children, and a carpenter family joined us. We didn&rsquo;t know that there was a blacksmith team in the village, we got one family who are into handlooms.</p>
<p>While this is happening some of us who know</p>
<p>the local language started making friends in the village and awakening them to all that is happening in the world. The villages become awakened to the idea of self sustainability. Their children who went to the city to make a career started to come back. Some villages offered their land on a 100 years lease to the</p>
<p>community trust to jointly develop it, the lease was renewed every 5 years and pushed to next 100 years, they also offered their time and manpower for the community to cultivate and rebuild the village. The community brought the villagers together and made a plan to unite all of them and all their land and rebuild the village with sustainable construction. By this time the community had purchased close to 100 acres of land from the profit they made but now the dynamics changed in the village there was no need for the land. By looking at all the development happening in</p>
<p>lands leased to the community other farmers also came forward to offer their land as well.</p>
<p>Urbanites who invested the money initially have been paid back. There was only one way to be part of the community now. It is to live together.</p>
<p>Byregowda, Madhavans and the Himanshu lived</p>
<p>a very peaceful life knowing that even when they are long gone Lalitha is taken care of by the community.</p>
<p>So are all the children. No children can be orphans anymore just because they lost their biological parents.</p>
<p>A true Bharatiya Joint family vyavastha was</p>
<p>established.</p>
<p>The whole village becomes one big community</p>
<p>where they cherished their life together. Since every inch of everyone&rsquo;s land was planned well using</p>
<p>permaculture principles the lake becomes full during the rainy season. Natural farming was adopted by the entire village. Together they decided to get rid of plastic everywhere and made sure no artificial waste goes to compost. Plantation areas were secured such</p>
<p>that cows can free grass in and around the village.</p>
<p>Villagers together improved the native grass diversity near lake and forest so that cows can graze. Many rules of old Bharat came into existence like soil of one village can&rsquo;t be taken to another village. Compost of this village remains only to this village. Take milk only for the family&rsquo;s needs. Milk, buttermilk and ghee is never sold to outsiders. Within the community it&rsquo;s alway a barter system.</p>
<p>Village lake is now filled with a diversity of</p>
<p>aquatic life. Since lakes were taken under the rule of the government and the government would tender to capitalists to use lakes for growing fishes of one or two varieties, the villages decided to pay to the government to keep it in their control. They</p>
<p>established a local governance within the village. The old homes which villages lived in earlier are kept as it is to show visitors before and after. Village also started to generate revenue as a tourist spot. Revenue generated through commerce like this was accounted for and tax was paid to the government at community</p>
<p>level which kept the government away from intervening into internal matters of the village.</p>
<p>And there was abundance in everything.</p>
<p>Spiritually people are awakened so there was no greed.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know what to do with so much produce other than selling.</p>
<p>The money accumulated by sales seemed</p>
<p>meaningless as every family now has more than</p>
<p>enough and they seem successful to the rest of the world. Villagers of this village were well respected by all the surrounding. Part of their produce they started to share with neighboring villages. Neighboring villages were invited to our cultural and religious celebrations from time to time where our children conveyed the community consciousness through stories and drama in the local language. Neighboring villages learnt about our model. They felt they can also live a beautiful life if they just change their mind set.</p>
<p>Some people who joined the community in the</p>
<p>initial phase and left later for any reason felt very bad</p>
<p>but the community welcomed them back with open hearts.</p>
<p>After the task which was put forth by divine was achieved (selflessly helping families from urban space to embrace natural living by establishing more</p>
<p>communities and transforming existing villages into self sustainable communities) and after completing a few years as a Waldorf teacher at Parippornam, Partha retired from all his initiatives. At the age of 52 Partha passed away and his body was buried in a place</p>
<p>which was pre-selected by him where a Kalpavruksha was planted. No structures were made above it to be sustainable and eco friendly, just the tree.</p>
<p>Multiple communities emerged all over India and around the world. The vote bank is now in the control of conscious people. Children raised out of such communities took leadership roles as MLAs and MPs.</p>
<p>At one point humans grew beyond the hindrance set before them by the evil and good prevailed. We reached to an extent where no paper could tell whose land is it and anyone wish to come and work in the land they were welcome because it&rsquo;s owned by all of us, it&rsquo;s a god&rsquo;s land and everyone who works in this land is basically serving the land and no one can stop someone from serving the god. Concept of money was no longer needed. Life was shared by fellow humans in abundance, in love and Joy. Gold, money were no longer considered as wealth but people understood that the real wealth is other fellow humans, the land, cows and horses, livestock, water, nature and all these living in harmony. A true paradise, heaven, Eldorado.</p>
