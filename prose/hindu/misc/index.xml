Men are targets of Love J_had as much as women are! A colleague‚Äôs younger brother worked in fashion industry. Let‚Äôs call him Ashish. He worked with a European brand making denim. There he met a young woman- let‚Äôs call her Shaheen.
Shaheen came across as liberal Mz. Loved Gujarati food which Ashish‚Äôs baa sent for him. Slowly she found place in his circle. They were seen together. The family was not conservative &amp;amp; thought this was merely a casual liking, they were sure Ashish would not go beyond friendship.</description>

For understandable reasons you can excuse me for not coming up with my real name as being a mother of one daughter and son at this age I would like to keep my identity intact.</description>

Autism fight With vicious personal attacks and slander on my character, it is time for me to respond. This is a deeply painful personal thread. My personal life, in contrast to my business life, has been a long tragedy. Autism destroyed our lives and left me suicidally depressed.
My wife Pramila and I were in this fight against autism for over 15 years. She is a super mom and her passionate cause is curing our son of autism.</description>
