      <description>New Doll
Translated from the original Bengali by Bhaswati Ghosh
Changing tastes There was a master craftsman who made dolls as playthings for little girls of the royal family. Every year, a doll fair was held in the palace courtyard. All other artisans accorded the master the highest honour at the fair.
When he was nearly eighty years old, there came a new craftsman. Youthful in age and fresh in his style, he was called Kishanlal.</description>
