      <description>When I met Vimalananda I had already been living in the city of Poona for more than a year, studying Ayurveda, India&amp;rsquo;s ancient medical system, and yoga. I had spiritual ambitions but despite guidance from saintly personages I had no real idea of my ultimate spiritual aim. Still, I dutifully invested many hours each day in postures and breathing exercises, holy books, incense and meditation while I waited impatiently for something to happen.</description>

      <description>A pleasing routine developed when Vimalananda visited Poona&amp;rsquo;s Trani colony. I would come over early to help prepare lunch, and then would go off to college in the afternoon. In the evenings we would go to the stables to visit his “four-legged children,” and on race days I would accompany him into the stands at the racecourse. After returning home we would sit together until late at night while he discoursed on spiritual subjects.</description>
