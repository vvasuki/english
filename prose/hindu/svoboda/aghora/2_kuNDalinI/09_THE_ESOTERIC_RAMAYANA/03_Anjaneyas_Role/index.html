  <p>Vimalananda paused for a moment and looked up to an image of Anjaneya, better known as Hanuman. His lip quivered almost imperceptibly with emotion as he spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anjaneya flew to Lanka, located Sita, and assured her that Rama was coming to rescue her. Before returning to Rama with the news of Sita&rsquo;s whereabouts Anjaneya allowed himself to be captured and taken before Ravana to make Ravana aware of the gravity of what he had done. Then Anjaneya burned the city of Lanka to the ground, destroying Ravana&rsquo;s lovely fantasy world.</p>
<p>“Actually Sita was responsible for the burning of Lanka. Ravana&rsquo;s minions wrapped Anjaneya&rsquo;s tail in oil-soaked rags to torment him. But when they lit the rags Sita prayed to the god of fire to refrain from burning his flesh, and Anjaneya felt no burning. In fact, he felt a wonderfully cool sensation; he felt cool enough to go calmly about his work of destroying the city. This prayer of Sita&rsquo;s is actually a mantra; if you know it you can sit in the fire for years on end and not even one of your hairs will be singed. After all, Sita is shita, cool. Wah, Ma, wah!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anjaneya was able to burn Lanka with the help of his tail. Think of the esoteric meaning here: Lanka stands for the Muladhara Chakra and the Earth Element. So that the Earth Element can no longer exert any effect on him whatsoever Anjaneya burned it, using his tail, which is attached to his body near the Muladhara Chakra. A sadhaka likewise totally “burns&rsquo; all con nection between Kundalini and the Earth Element with the help of prana moving in the Muladhara.</p>
<p>“After burning Lanka, Anjaneya returned to Rama—he is totally devoted to Ramaand with the help of the other monkeys built a bridge so that</p>
<p>(242)</p>
<p>THE ESOTERIC RAMAYANA</p>
<p>Rama could cross over to Lanka. This process is called Setu Bandha. Inter nally, this bridge connects the Muladhara Chakra to the Manipura Chakra, bridging the Svadhishthana Chakra. This particular bridge can only be built by a perfect celibate, someone like Anjaneya who is not in the least tempted by any enjoyment which the Svadhishthana, the sex chakra, can offer him.</p>
<p>“Anjaneya is strictly chaste, which is unusual for a monkey; most mon keys spend their days mating or masturbating. But then, Anjaneya is a mon key in form only. He is an incarnation of Lord Shiva, and he is sufficiently aware of his true nature that he is not affected, or is affected very little, by his simian nature.</p>
<p>“By bridging the ocean—the Water Element Anjaneya was freed from being affected by Water. This is a permanent bridge; when Anjaneya does something it is impossible to change it. Even the extemal bridge that was built became permanent. Once Arjuna tried to be clever and destroy the real bridge, and he got nowhere. How could he possibly compete with the brav ery and strength of Anjaneya, who is Mahavira Balavant (the &lsquo;Great and Pow erful Hero&rsquo;)?</p>
<p>“You know the story of the Ramayana. Have you ever wondered why it was necessary to build a bridge over the sea from India to Lanka so that Rama and his armies could cross it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“The bridge was necessary because the ocean refused to cooperate with Rama. When every other living thing in the world was cooperating with Rama because they loved him so much, why wouldn&rsquo;t the ocean cooper</p>
<p>ate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good question; the story should be logical.</p>
<p>“Some people think it was because Anjaneya wanted to show off and become famous, but that is impossible; he is the epitome of devoted ser vice, the single-minded servant of Rama. He has no other thought than for Rama. The answer lies in the Churning of the Ocean, at the time of the Kurma Avatara.”</p>
<p>Of course! How elegant! &ldquo;The ocean was terribly tortured during the churning. How would you like to be churned? So although the ocean cooperated with Vishnu when Vishnu returned in the form of the Rama Avatara, it cooperated grudgingly, and partially. There was no alternative but to build a bridge.”</p>
<p>“So after the ocean of the body is tortured by the churning of prana that is nec essary to generate the Amrita, a new channel must be created—is this the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>( 243 )</p>
<p>AGHORA II: Kundalini</p>
<p>“You&rsquo;re getting there,&quot; he laughed. “Keep thinking about it. After the bridge was completed Rama, Lakshmana, Anjaneya and the monkeys invaded Lanka and the battles between the forces of Rama and Ravana began. At one point Lakshmana was seriously wounded. The chief physi cian reported that unless the sanjivani herb, which can restore the dead to life, was brought within a few hours, Lakshmana would die. That herb was available only on a certain mountain in the Himalayas, Rama was distraught at the possibility of losing Lakshmana, His right arm, so Anjaneya volun teered to bring back sanjivani. He flew to the mountain but could not find the herb, so in order to save time he uprooted the entire mountain and car ried it back to Rama. Sanjivani was located, Lakshmana was saved, and Anjaneya returned the mountain to its proper place.</p>
<p>“You may have seen pictures of Anjaneya flying through the air with a mountain in his hand; they are illustrations of this story. Think about its meaning for a moment. I&rsquo;m not going to spell it out for you; that would be too easy. But it involves Lakshmana, the one-pointed concentration of the mind; Anjaneya, who here is the body&rsquo;s prana; and the mountain from the Himalayas, the vertebral column which contains the spinal cord with its physical nerves and subtle nadis.</p>
<p>He let me think on these things for a few moments, and then said, “Now let me make this story even more complicated for you.&quot;</p>
<p>“Thanks,&quot; I replied sardonically.</p>
<p>“As Anjaneya flew over Ayodhya with the mountain, Rama&rsquo;s brother and regent Bharata saw him in the sky and, taking him for a demon, shot him down with an arrow. When he realized his mistake he was horrified, but Anjaneya reassured him and continued on his way. There was a sadhu I knew in Girnar who worshipped Anjaneya in the form of &lsquo;Langde Lal’: Anjaneya who limps from the arrow in his thigh. In fact, the sadhu who blessed M. to be able to recite the Ramayana so well worshipped Langde Lal.&quot;</p>
<p>“Were they the same sadhu?&quot;</p>
<p>“I don&rsquo;t know.” He did know, clearly, and quickly proceeded with his point: “Think for just a moment: Anjaneya is immortal, a superman. How could an arrow shot by a mortal, even one so powerful as Bharata, even scratch his skin?”</p>
<p>Another conundrum.</p>
<p>He continued: “This is easy enough to understand: Bharata did every thing in Rama&rsquo;s name. He even shot his arrow in Rama&rsquo;s name. Anjaneya is utterly devoted to Rama, and only when an arrow with Rama&rsquo;s name hits</p>
<p>[244]</p>
<p>THE ESOTERIC RAMAYANA</p>
<p>him does he fall. And only when Bharata, Rama&rsquo;s viceroy, gives him leave to go in the name of Rama can he depart.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is becoming difficult to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“These things take time to digest. Keep trying! Anjaneya helped Rama conquer and kill Ravana. Now, Rama and Ravana both begin with &lsquo;R.&rsquo; In India the first letter of a person&rsquo;s first name reflects where the moon is in that person&rsquo;s horoscope. Have you noticed how people whose names begin with the same letter, which means that they have the same moon sign, are often enemies? Astrologically it is not supposed to be this way; they should be friends. But often they are enemies: Krishna and Kamsa, Jesus and Judas, Gandhi and Godse.&quot;</p>
<p>“True enough. But of course Jesus and Judas were not from India.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but remember the phonetic value of words. Names in India are given in this way to help balance out the mind; the moon controls the mind, especially the emotional side of the mind. Whatever your name, it is going to exert a strong effect on you, because everytime someone calls you by that name, and everytime you think of yourself by name, the phonetic value of that name will affect your consciousness, just like a mantra does.”</p>
<p>Wow. “That means that there are billions of people out there in the world who have the wrong names! Which means their very names are probably unbalancing them even further!&quot;</p>
<p>“Definitely. But after all, this is Kali Yuga, you know; you have to expect this sort of thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about my name?”</p>
<p>“As it turns out, your name should have started with r&rsquo;anyway, so there is no problem.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a coincidence, or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or something. You share the same moon sign as both Rama and Ravana. &lsquo;R&rsquo; represents Ram Bija, the Fire Element; anyone who worships Rama is actually worshipping fire. Ravana is Fire still polluted by the limited ahamkara; Rama is the Eternal Soul, pure Fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I understood: so long as my own innate selfishness remains I remain equivalent to Ravana, no matter how great and powerful I may become; but there is a chance, should I purify my own Fire Element sufficiently, that I might yet achieve Rama.</p>
<p>“After Anjaneya frees himself of all traces of egotism by helping Rama he is then free of all limitations associated with the Fire Element. A tiny trace of individual effort remained when he burned Lanka; this is why his tail was</p>
<p>[245]</p>
<p>AGHORA II: Kundalini</p>
<p>set alight. Even then Sita prevented him from being burned. Once he is free of every taint, though, Fire can no longer touch him at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Rama killed Ravana Sita was freed from the demon&rsquo;s clutches, and returned to her rightful husband. In the body of the sadhaka this suggests that the Fire Element becomes totally purified; the Kundalini Shakti is freed from the clutches of Jathara Agni and is returned to the influence of Bhuta Agni. When Sita is retrieved she must submit to an ordeal by fire to prove that she has maintained her purity, that she has not been tainted by Jathara Agni. You must submit to a similar, but internal, test at this stage; if you pass, you become free of the need to eat.</p>
<p>“From the Manipura Chakra the Kundalini goes to the Anahata Chakra. Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and a few others flew from Lanka back to Rama&rsquo;s capital Ayodhya in a sort of airplane, the Pushpaka Vimana. It is natural that they would fly, since the Anahata is the seat of the Air Element. Anjaneya is the son of the wind god. He is in his own element at the Anahata, and it is here that a sadhaka can meet him. The doors to his three lower chakras are irrevocably closed, so you will never chance upon him there; and when his consciousness is in the Vishuddha or higher, how will you be able to contact him? Beyond the Anahata he can see only Rama.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to the Anahata you can still be aware of other individuals and have a desire to play about with them, though you see them all as forms of your Beloved. This is why fakirs (Muslim sadhus), once they reach ‘chauthe asmaan,&rsquo; the Fourth Heaven, are always doing work for people and helping out the helpless. The Fourth Heaven is the Fourth Chakra, the Anahata. Once you reach the Vishuddha, though, there is ‘vishesha shuddhi&rsquo; (&lsquo;spe cial purification&rsquo;) and there is no wish of any kind. And beyond the Vishud dha are the Ajna, where all that remains is the consciousness of individuality, and the Sahasrara, where nothing remains. No, if you want to meet Anjaneya you must do so at the heart.</p>
<p>“When you are endangered, why does your hand go to your chest? Because Vishnu is the presiding deity of the Anahata Chakra, and you are instinctively requesting him to save you, to preserve your life. Anjaneya, the servant of Vishnu in the form of Rama, is also a Rudra, an aspect of Shiva, the Destroyer. So it is no wonder that the Anahata Chakra is the place of both life and death.</p>
<p>“Have you seen pictures of Anjaneya ripping open his chest with his fin gernails to show that nothing remains in his heart but the purest form of Rama?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought for a moment before replying, “Those that I have seen usually</p>
<p>[246]</p>
<p>THE ESOTERIC RAMAYANA</p>
<p>show both Sita and Rama together in Anjaneya&rsquo;s heart.”</p>
<p>“Yes, most do, but that is incorrect; Rama alone resides there. People sometimes speak of Anjaneya and Rama as different, but they are wrong. In fact, Anjaneya is Rama&rsquo;s heart.”</p>
<p>“What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Anjaneya is prana, the son of wind; he causes the heart to beat. How could Rama ever exist without His heart? Here is a story for you: Once Sita was complaining to Rama. &lsquo;O Aryaputra (Son of the Just),&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;sometimes I want to have a private conversation with you, but we are never alone. Anjaneya is always with us. Please send him out now and let us talk alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>“Rama replied, &lsquo;O wife, what are you saying? What is there for you to tell me that Anjaneya cannot hear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>“Sita answered, &lsquo;I have some private womanly work, and since Anjaneya is not married he cannot listen.</p>
<p>“Rama said, “All right, just to please you I will send Anjaneya away for a short time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>“He turned and spoke to Anjaneya: &lsquo;I will inform you when the discus sion is over; then come back in. Meanwhile, please go out and eat some fruit from the trees in the garden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>“So Anjaneya went out to the garden. He looked at the fruit trees but couldn&rsquo;t bear to pluck any fruit from them; how could he hurt them? So he sat underneath a shady tree and began to sing a song in praise of His master Rama. Soon he was lost in samadhi.</p>
<p>“About this time Rama inexplicably began to yawn. But Anjaneya was so intent on his song.&ndash;Ram Ram Sitaram, Ram Ram Sitaram&rsquo;-that he had completely forgotten his earthly existence, and he continued to sit and sing.</p>
<p>“Rama was in a fix. He was yawning incessantly and no one could cure Him. They called His personal physician, who checked His pulse and said that there was no underlying pathology. They called the astrologer, who said that all the planets were in good positions and there were no inauspicious signs. Finally, after calling a few more people, they called Rama&rsquo;s brother Lakshmana. He also did not know what to do, but he did remember to call Anjaneya.</p>
<p>“Anjaneya was out in the garden, deep in samadhi. By continuously chanting &lsquo;Sitaram Sitaram&rsquo; into his ears for many minutes Lakshmana with difficulty brought Anjaneya back to earthly consciousness, and told him, &lsquo;Something is wrong with Lord Rama.&rsquo;</p>
<p>AGHORA II: Kundalini</p>
<p>“In one jump Anjaneya was in the palace, and the moment Rama saw Him the yawning stopped.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yawn was Rama&rsquo;s way of telling Anjaneya to return to the palace?&rdquo; &ldquo;You are a student of Ayurveda; what can you tell me about yawning?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is caused by an abnormal upward movement of prana-oh. I see.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct. Anyway, Sita learned a good lesson: wherever Rama is Anjaneya must be there also, and vice versa. But it is also true that wherever Rama is Sita must be also. Once Sita asked Anjaneya, &lsquo;Do you like Rama&rsquo;s lotus feet better, or mine?&rsquo; A tough question; how could Anjaneya insult either His beloved Rama or Rama&rsquo;s Shakti Sita? So He told her, &lsquo;Your lotus feet are the softest and most enjoyable, while Rama&rsquo;s are a little hard; but for liberation none can surpass Rama&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>“Now, I have always loved Anjaneya; he is my most beloved deity. But here he was wrong. Without Sita Rama was nothing; there are so many instances that he had to come begging to Anjaneya for help. Only the Divine Mother can grant liberation; nothing is higher than Ma. Only a few, like Anjaneya, can go beyond Maya, the transitory, to Rama, the permanent, and they all do so by Ma&rsquo;s grace, nothing else.”</p>
<p>Hmm. “So Rama requires Anjaneya, Sita and Lakshmana to be com plete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Yes, which is why He is called Perfection Encompassed; He is the Perfect Man, but is subject to limits. This is why you always find all four images in a temple of Rama. They form a team; they cannot be separated from one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After returning to Ayodhya Rama ruled as king, assisted by Lakshmana, Sita and Anjaneya. His rule, called Rama Rajya, was an ideal time in which to live; all was harmonious throughout His kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And esoterically, I suppose, Rama Rajya happens whenever someone attains Rama-consciousness in this way.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Regardless of when or where Rama lived and ruled on Earth, Rama Rajya happens whenever a sadhaka realizes the Rama within himself or herself and installs that Rama as the Inner Ruler.</p>
<p>“Rama ruled peacefully and happily for many years, but since all that is created must be destroyed, no matter how perfect it may be, one day Mahakala, Who is Time Personified, came to have a chat with Him. Mahakala stipulated that Rama must immediately disown anyone who might happen to disturb their conversation; He wanted no worldly influ ence whatsoever to interfere.</p>
<p>( 248 )</p>
<p>THE ESOTERIC RAMAYANA</p>
<p>“As it happened Lakshmana did not know about this stipulation, and he inadvertently disturbed Rama and Mahakala. Rama, who always kept His word, had no alternative but to reject Lakshmana permanently. Lakshmana decided that life without Rama was not worth living, and so he jumped into the river which flows through Ayodhya, the Sarayu, and ended himself.</p>
<p>“Rama is the true, permanent, undying, indwelling Self. Lakshmana is eka iaksha, concentration on a single point: the mind riveted on Rama. Even the last object or laksha in the consciousness must be dissolved before Nir vikalpa Samadhi becomes possible. In an individual sadhaka this final dis tinction jumps into the Sarayu in the forehead, a nadi which arises from Manasasarovara, the &lsquo;Lake of the Mind&rsquo; within the brain. When concentra tion itself drowns and merges with the infinite only Rama remains, because Sita has meanwhile returned to her source, the womb of Mother Earth. The soul has now relinquished everything, even its own Shakti, its own personal Maya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Rama loses Lakshmana He loses all desire to continue to exist, and after bidding farewell to Anjaneya He enters the river Himself. When Rama merges, there is Nirvikalpa Samadhi, and the play of the Ramayana is ended.</p>
<p>“Everyone dies or disappears in the end except Anjaneya. Rama tells Anjaneya, &lsquo;Although I am God incarnate I must also die. But you are the incarnation of Rudra, the God of Death Himself. You cannot die.&rsquo; And it is true. Anjaneya can never die. He is immortal like Mahakala, the original Rudra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“I know that Anjaneya is a matronymic, a name derived from his mother&rsquo;s name, Anjani,&rdquo; I said. “I also know how much you love Ma. But is there some specific reason you insist on calling Anjaneya Anjaneya, and almost never call him Hanuman or Maruti?&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Well, being a worshipper of Ma I always like to remind myself of Her. And-Anjaneya may be a great hero, but even he has to listen to his mother.</p>
<p>“When Anjaneya went to meet his mother after Sita had been rescued he related the whole story of the Ramayana to her, and then told her, ‘Ma, I have been true to your milk. I have dedicated my life entirely to Sri Ram achandra, so much so that I have even become a celibate. I will never even look on any woman except you and Sita Ji.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anjani told him, &lsquo;How can you tell me that you have been true to my milk, when you could have taken Sita Ji back to Rama yourself directly with out the need for any war? No, you have shamed my milk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>“Anjaneya replied to her, ‘No, Ma, I could not do that. I can only do what</p>
<p>[ 2491</p>
<p>AGHORA II: Kundalini</p>
<p>Lord Rama orders me to do. If I had been so ordered I would have done everything myself and Ramachandra Ji would not have had to lift even his little finger. But by doing as I was told other good things happened. For example, all the Rakshasas (demonic beings) who saw me changed their inherent natures and started to worship Rama, thanks to the beautiful form you gave me.&rsquo; And then his mother was mollified. Did you know that Anjaneya is described as ‘koti kandarpa lavanya?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see: &rsquo;the beauty of ten million kandarpas.” “But doesn&rsquo;t kandarpa mean onion&rsquo; in Sanskrit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does, but is that its only meaning? Do you think anyone would refer to Anjaneya as having the beauty of ten million onions? Of course not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>True enough. I stretched to think of other meanings of “kandarpa,&rdquo; and then told him, “Kandarpa is one of the names of Kamadeva, the god of love.&quot;</p>
<p>“Right. Now imagine how handsome the god of love must be, and then multiply by ten million. Then you will have an idea of Anjaneya&rsquo;s beauty, But that is not all. &lsquo;Kandarpa&rsquo; also refers to a particular type of prana which is connected with Apana; the kanda is the nadi-plexus where Apana can be made to move upward instead of downward.</p>
<p>“Now here is another question for you: since Anjaneya always meditates on Rama, never forgetting Him for an instant, why hasn&rsquo;t he become Rama, according to the Law of Caterpillar and Butterfly?&quot;</p>
<p>He was enjoying this. “I don&rsquo;t know.&quot;</p>
<p>“The answer is simple: He does not become Rama because he deliber ately does not want to. He is Shiva, Who knows only how to give, not to take, even if it is only a question of form. This is why Shiva is called the Great Giver.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; My concentration was evidently flagging. Vimalananda indulgently smiled at me like the Divine Mother Herself and ended our conversation by saying, “So now you know something of what I am thinking when I listen to the Ramayana.&quot;</p>

<p>The Ten Mahavidya Goddesses originate from the legend of Shiva and his first consort Sati. Incensed at the refusal of her father Daksa to invite her ascetic husband to the great sacrifice, Sati manifests the ten powerful forms of the Mahavidya Goddesses. Sati eventually destroys herself, and Shiva overcome with grief allows Vishnu to dissect her body and scatter it over the subcontinent of India. The places where the various parts of her body fell became the sacred sites (shaktipithas) of Devi worship, wherein the land itself embodies the sacred form of the dismembered goddess. From this legend derives the practice of Sati, where the faithful wife offers herself to her husband&rsquo;s funeral pyre. Some of the Mahavidyas, such as Kali and Tara, have several forms. Vimalananda self-identified with Tara, the second of the Mahavidyas, in her form as Smashan Tara. “Tara of the Cremation Grounds.&quot;</p>
