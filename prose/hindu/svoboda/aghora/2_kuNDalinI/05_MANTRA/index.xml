      <description>“Many people talk about Mantra Siddhi (the manifestation of the deity inherent in the mantra), but I am afraid that most of them have missed the boat. Let&amp;rsquo;s say that I want to locate you, and I know your name. But that alone is not enough. I must also know what you look like and where you live, because there may be many people with the same name. Only if I know your likes and dislikes, your temperament, all the facets of your character, do I really know you.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;How will I know which form I have an affinity for?&amp;rdquo;
“That is the job of your guru, to assign you the proper mantra and the proper form. He will know which mantras are appropriate for you. If you are of a very tender nature and you start to repeat a mantra for some terrifying deity like Smashan Tara you may scare yourself to death. If you are prone to greed and you worship Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, you may simply enhance your greed, which will not help you progress.</description>

      <description>“Both anusthanas and purashcharanas require you to follow what we call in Sanskrit the path of the Five S&amp;rsquo;s: sthana, samaya, sankhya, samagri, and samyama. The purpose of these rules is to achieve the sa-guna or mr anifested form of the deity. You know Sanskrit; translate these words.”
&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Sthana&amp;rsquo; means location.”
&amp;ldquo;So first you must stay in one location throughout the duration of your penance and not travel about. Moreover, you must sit in the same place each day, face in the same direction, and if possible sit in the same posi tion.</description>

      <description>Some days later when I was in Bombay I accompanied Vimalananda on an uneventful visit to K., one of his old friends. Afterward I noticed that Vim alananda was quieter than usual, so after we reached home and had tea I casually asked him, &amp;ldquo;Have you known that gentleman for very long?&amp;rdquo;

He replied, “There are many restrictions to follow if you really want to perfect a mantra.</description>

      <title>05 Pronunciation</title>

      <description>I could see that mantras were really very useful things. “Telling your mantra to someone else is fatal, but there are other mistakes which can also ruin you. Mispronunciation is one of the worst. The way a word is pronounced has a lot to do with its meaning. For instance, when you come in and I say, &amp;lsquo;Hello, Robby, how are you?&amp;rsquo; with a pleasant voice and a smiling face, how do you feel?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Of course the Rishis and their disciples knew how to pronounce Sanskrit properly.&amp;rdquo;
“Yes they did, and they knew other things as well, including how to best make use of all four levels of speech.&amp;quot; As I racked my brain for any informa tion I might have collected on that subject, he continued. “You know, speech is not a product of the mind; speech is an independent creative fac ulty, a sense which operates through the mind.</description>

      <description>“And all this is due to the chemical composition of the speaker&amp;rsquo;s con sciousness,&amp;quot; I volunteered, as I thought I knew which direction Vimalanan da’s discourse was heading
He nodded his assent. “And this chemical composition determines what sort of sadhana is appropriate for you, what you can succeed at. There is no lack of people today who claim to have located the keys to the Vedas, and who claim that they are living a &amp;lsquo;Vedic&amp;rsquo; life, and teaching their disciples &amp;lsquo;Vedic&amp;rsquo; sadhanas.</description>
