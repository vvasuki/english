      <description>&amp;ldquo;So any kind of music, Western, Indian, or anything else, can give you results if you are sincere about it and make it into a sadhana,&amp;rdquo; I said.
&amp;ldquo;You can. I am sure that if Tukaram Maharaj, who lived here in Maharashtra almost four hundred years ago, were to come here to Bombay today and we were to play some nice Western song for him he would sit quietly and listen and enjoy it—or at least he would look as if he were enjoying it.</description>

“My family belongs to the Pushti Marga, the spiritual path (marga) whose greatest exponent was Vallabhacharya, who lived more than five hundred years ago. Some people translate &amp;lsquo;Pushti Marga&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;Path of Prosperity,&amp;rsquo; and others as ‘Path of Grace.&amp;rsquo; But when I think of pushti I remember a phrase from the Maha Mrytunjaya Mantra.” He looked at me expectantly.
&amp;ldquo;You mean, &amp;lsquo;sugandhim pushti vardhanam?</description>

      <description>He paused to sip his drink.
&amp;ldquo;When Kundalini enters the Anahata Chakra you begin to hear the Ana hata Nada, which will sound either like Krishna&amp;rsquo;s flute or Shiva&amp;rsquo;s drum depending on which path you follow. Other Nadas are also described in the books, but these two are the most important.
“Let me try to explain to you the differences in Nada by describing how Krishna&amp;rsquo;s hair differs from Shiva&amp;rsquo;s hair.</description>
