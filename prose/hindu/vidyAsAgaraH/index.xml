Prof. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam - A Personal Reminiscence
-- Dr. M. Vidyasagar
Now that Bharat Ratna Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam will be the next President of India, I felt bold enough to peep into my memories and come up with this very personal reminiscence. Everyone knows about the various &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; incidents in Prof. Kalam&amp;rsquo;s life, so this reminiscence is restricted only to incidents in which I personally participated.</description>

Articles on Returning to India
विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्) In May and June of 1993, I spent two months visiting the Institute of Mathematics and Applications at the University of Minnesota. During that period, I wrote some articles for the Indian newsgroups on my experiences after returning to India. Since that time, I have been pleasantly surprised at the number of persons who claim to have read them. They are reproduced here.</description>
