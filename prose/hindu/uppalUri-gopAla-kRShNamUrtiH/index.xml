      <description>First and Last Public Talk of U.G. after his Calamity
[At the Indian Institute of World Culture Bangalore in the year 1972]
Let me, at the very outset, thank the authorities of the Indian Institute of World Culture for giving me this opportunity to meet you all here. I was very reluctant to accept the invitation of Mr. Venkataramaiah. But somehow, if I may use that word, I was trapped into this kind of a thing.</description>

He joined the Indian Administrative Service in the Nehru administration as Chief Engineer in the Sindhri Fertilizer Factory and resigned the job when Nehru pressured him to go to Russia. He then dedicated himself to spiritual pursuits under the guidance of the Sankaracharya of Kudli Math in the Karnataka State, who subsequently chose him as his successor.</description>

INTRODUCTION Trying to understand U.G. or his teachings is like trying to grasp the wind in the palm of your hand. Yet they are as refreshing and fragrant as a fresh breeze, but they can also be as devastating as a wild fire! They are as nourishing as the earth and water, if only we can just listen to them and then &amp;ldquo;forget all about them!</description>

      <description>The Sage and the Housewife
By Shanta Kelker
Stories of U.G. in Bangalore
0 This book on U.G.Krishnamurti brings a whiff of fresh air in an atmosphere infested with self-proclaimed godmen, gurus and pseudo-religious seekers. If you like to tread a path of adventure risking your pet beliefs, assumed certainties and habitual hypocrisies, you will love this unique work by a simple and ordinary housewife. Her spontaneous encounters with the enigmatic sage are full of wit and humor.</description>

The Teachings of U.G.Krishnamurti: A Case Study
[Paper presented by Dr. J.S.R.L.Narayana Moorty at the Krishnamurti Centennial Conference held at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, U.S.A., May 18-21, 1995]
The following paper discusses some issues commonly raised in regard to the relationship between science and spirituality. In particular, I wish to examine the issue of the apparent similarities (or symmetry) between statements made by scientists and those made by mystics concerning the unity of existence (or of the universe).</description>

      <description>Courage to Stand Alone
0 FOREWORD When I heard from my friend, Julie Thayer, that the 1982 audio series of &amp;ldquo;Give Up&amp;rdquo; are going to be put in print I was much pleased and I immediately agreed to the proposal. She called me from New York and asked me if I could write a note on how these tapes came about. I gratefully answered.
When U.G. invited me in July 1978 to come to Bangalore, where he stayed in his friends&amp;rsquo; house and from where he arranged his Indian travels in those times, my immediate answer was, &amp;ldquo;Yes Sir, I would like to.</description>

      <description>U.G.: NEITHER KNOWLEDGE NOR WISDOM THERE IS NOBODY THERE
By
Jean-Michel Terdjman
What U.G. is telling us is not contradictory, incoherent or illogical. It may seem so because we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to take it. We don&amp;rsquo;t know how to take it because what has been called his &amp;ldquo;teaching&amp;rdquo; is no teaching at all. U.G. is always enunciating mere statements of fact, in their rawest possible form. He does not provide us with the context, the perspective necessary to see how they fit.</description>

(OR ONE BLIND MAN&amp;rsquo;S ELEPHANT)
An Introduction to U. G. and his Teaching
By:
J.S.R.L.Narayana Moorty
U. G. Krishnamurti was born in Andhra Pradesh in 1918. He studied Philosophy in Madras University. He had early training in the scriptures and meditation. His quest, like many before, was spiritual&amp;ndash;to realize the Self. He is indeed said to have attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi. Notwithstanding, his quest remained.</description>
