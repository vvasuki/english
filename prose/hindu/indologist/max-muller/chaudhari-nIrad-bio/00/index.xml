      <description>Lady Blennerhasset, a well-known literary and social figure of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, wrote to Mrs Max Muller after the death of her husband ‘My admiration for your husband makes me envy the task of him or her, who will be his biographer There are few lives so rich, so attractive, so truly interesting, from the intellectual and purely human point of view ’
During the four years which I took to write this biography I have felt that she was right in saying so It has been a memorable experience for me, and not merely a task The introduction which follows will explain why I undertook to write Max Muller’s life anew after the first and last biography so far written was published in 1902 Here I shall only set down my obligations</description>

      <description>The fact that Max Muller was German by birth and spent his early life in Germany, has quite unnecessarily fixed the idea that he was a German scholar writing in German Actually, he was naturalized in England and always wrote in English with complete mastery of the language, except when he employed German for a special purpose in a book, article, or his correspondence The lists given in the two appendices specify which books or documents are in German All others are in his own English</description>

      <description>This book is a biography, that is to say, an account of the life of a man who was a scholar and a thinker, it is not except incidentally a discussion or evaluation of his work in the fields of knowledge with which his scholarship was concerned But a biography should not be inflicted on a reading public without proper justification, I do not think that a man is entitled to such treatment only on the strength of his position and fame in his own age, unless in addition he played so important and significant a role in history that he remains an element to be reckoned with in understanding the continuing evolution of a particular people or humanity in general; nor unless his personality and activities belong to a type whose presence and functiomng is continuous and umversal, so that no outstanding individual of the type ever loses his relevance to all ages</description>
