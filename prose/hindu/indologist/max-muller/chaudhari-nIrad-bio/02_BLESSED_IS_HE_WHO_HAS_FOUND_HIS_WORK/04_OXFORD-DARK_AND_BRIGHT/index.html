  <p>Chapter 4</p>
<p>OXFORD-DARK AND BRIGHT</p>
<p>By the time Max Muller, as Taylorian Professor, had become an associate member, so to speak, of the academic club of Oxford — the date being February 1854 — the university had ceased to be the happy convent it was even in 1848 The Pax Oxomana was shattered at one stroke by the appointment of the Royal Commission of 1850 As Mark Pattison said, if a man had fallen asleep in 1846 and woken up again in 1850 he would have found himself in a different world It was tom into two factions, the opponents and the supporters of reform The old guard was in power, and feeling ran so high against the renegades that one of them asked a junior professor to invite him to dinner because the heads of colleges would no longer admit him to their table Actually, the Commission made a difference to the social habits of Oxford Before its appointment there were hardly any private dinners besides those in the halls But the Commission broke up the academic society into sets, and private dinners had to keep up the social life of those who were excluded from the high table on account of their support for reform</p>
<p>The umversity as an official body refused to co-operate with the Commission It questioned not only the kind of reform that was proposed, but also the power of Parliament to legislate for Oxford ‘The Government did not know Oxford, nor Oxford the Government/ was the accepted formula, and men who were thoroughgoing Erastians in always submitting to the supremacy of the State over the Anglican Church, now opposed the intervention of the State in the affairs of an organ of the same Church — the University of Oxford As Max Muller found, even those who thought reform necessary were afraid of calling in the government Some of them told him that if they once let in the government, it would interfere too much</p>
<p>The case of the opponents of reform, a majority of whom certainly put the vested interests of a closed corporation before education, was stated at its most idealistic and disinterested by Dr Pusey He was never in doubt about the basic issue, which in his eyes was clear should Oxford continue to be a religious body in</p>

<p>obedience to the intentions of the founders, or was it to become merely a seculai educational institution ? He had only one answer to the question He did not object to improvements, but declared firmly ‘Only let it be xeally solid, and, above all, under the control of a firm, unwavering faith, to the glory of God It will yet be well with Oxfoid if she forget not her own motto — Dominus illummatio mea &rsquo; None the less, the Commission reported, and the reform bill was passed What shocked the anti-reform men most was that Gladstone, the member for Oxford and at first an opponent of State interference, became a convert himself and carried through the reforming measures in Parliament For this he was to lose his seat later But reform was set in motion, and Dr Pusey, who was to fight the rearguard action against it to the last, could only lament Fuit Ilium, futt Ilium f — We were Trojans once, but Troy is gone 1</p>
<p>Of course, old Oxford did not die at once For at least two decades it kicked very hard, and even after that a core of antireform opinion remained there, just as Jacobitism survived into the Hanoverian age The most characteristic expression of the conservative attitude is to be found in seven volumes of reproductions of Oxford caricatures preserved in the Bodleian Satire is always conservative, as the whole tradition from Aristophanes to Punch proves 3o were these caricatures, and even more so their captions, in nany instances in faultless Greek or Latin, which showed that eform had served even the satirists by raising the level of classical iducation at Oxford</p>
<p>As was to be expected, all the champions of reform came in for heir share of ridicule or censure, and most of all Jowett, who was lot only a very active reformer, but was also suspected of having a jood deal of arriere-pensee in his reforming zeal</p>
<p>Academic refoim at Oxford in the second half of the nineteenth entury, like parliamentary reform, was earned out in three stages, ►efore and after 1854 by a commission of inquiry, an Act of Parharient and an executive commission There was in 1872 another ommission of inquiry, and an Act of 1877 This was followed by n executive commission from 1877 to 1881 As a result, there was ubstantial improvement in details of organization as *vell as teachig But there was no revolutionary change in the university&rsquo;s formal ructure and functioning For instance, the very basil issues which le reformers had raised, such as the relation betwecnlhe university id the colleges, the imbalance between professori jf and tutorial</p>
<p>[[204]]</p>
<p>teaching, of the extension of research, were dealt with superficially and remained open even till after the First World War, when they had to be examined again</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a great change certainly came over the spirit in which Oxford carried on its work This was due far less to the specific measures of reform than to the Zeitgeist , illustrating the invariable principle that it is the society which shapes the educational system, and not the system the society</p>
<p>Once anybody wanted to see it, the basic transformation was all too obvious As an institution, from having been an educational monastery run by a clerical oligarchy deriving its authority from an overwhelmingly clerical franchise of Masters of Art, the university became for all practical purposes a secular body In function, it ceased to be primarily a clerical seminary, and though it did not lose its novices, it became the educational centre of a modern bureaucratic State and a worldwide Imperial polity In putting their classical disciplines to this extended use, the dons of Oxford took a great deal of pride as the teachers of senators, consuls and proconsuls But m reality it was the British Imperial State which made the umversity serve it, in the same way as the schools of rhetoric and law in Rome and the schools of philosophy in Athens served the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Naturally schooling, widened and immensely improved, remained the mam function of Oxford, and the dominance of the colleges and the tutorial system continued Among the students the crammers more or less balanced the idlers Despite all that, the outstanding feature of the reformed Oxford was not that it became a better university, but that it was converted into a very advanced public school For its students Greek and Latin meant what they did at Eton, Harrow or Rugby, and by an unwritten convention sport and games became a part of the academic curriculum As a result, they lost their free and personal character, and became organized, obligatory, strenuous and honoured disciplines Those who regarded boat-racing as being as much a part of Oxford education as were the Greats, did not always recollect, even if they were dons instead of undergraduates, how recent this was. Muscular Christianity pleached by some Oxford men never became a force m English life, but muscular umversity education did</p>
<p>With this transformation Oxford ceased to be the home of dreams and lost causes, and offered a complete contrast to its past by becoming a participant in British success and by affiliating itself</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[205]]</p>
<p>to the imperial greatness of Britain Gladstone, who set the reforming movement going, did not seem to be wholly satisfied with what he had sponsored, and on his deathbed he could only recall the Oxford dedicated to the glory of God which he had known in his student days Thus to a message sent to him by the Hebdomadal Council in 1898 he replied £ There is no expression of Christian sympathy that I value more than that of the ancient university of Oxford, the God-fearing and God-sustaimng university of Oxford. I served her, perhaps mistakenly, but to the best of my ability ’ But that Oxford of his was as dead as that of Newman By the end of the century Oxford had transferred its allegiance from God to Caesar.</p>
<p>The imperialistic re-orientation of Oxford quite naturally brought into existence a worship and awareness of Oxford education such as had not existed before The men who passed out from unreformed Oxford took their association with it for granted, as they did their parentage and their ancestral homes But the products of reformed Oxford began to look upon themselves as members of a corps d’ehte, and acquired a feeling for it which was similar to conscious family pride In the normal English Oxonian, this pride remained unassertive and reticent, though at times very studiedly so and therefore not quite convincing in its modesty But among those Englishmen who went out from Oxford to the colonies and dependencies, and among the White colonials and the Orientals who came to Oxford, the cult of Oxford became meretricious, and even dubious</p>
<p>The worship of Oxford as exported was of a piece with the English imperialistic sentiment of the late mneteenth century, which was self-conscious, intellectually shoddy, and wholly unworthy of the historic phenomenon that the British Empire in its practical existence really was Thus it was natural that Cecil Rhodes, the most counterfeit of English imperialists, who thought that spectacular financial success in a colony (and of all places on the Rand), gave him a right to patronize the British Empire, should become a benefactor of Oxford And the callowness of the imperialism of Oxford was shown by its grateful acceptance of his bounty Even Oriel accepted it, and allowed Rhodes Gaudens to look down on the university church of St Mary the Virgin from his niche in the pediment opposite</p>
<p>But the most baneful impact of imperialistic Oxford was seen m the Indians who came there. The English civil servants and educationalists in India were mostly from one or other of the two</p>
<p>[[206]]</p>
<p>ancient universities, and they buttressed their prestige there by fostering an abject worship of Oxford and Cambridge among Indians So the more ambitious and wealthy among them came over for their higher education, which was really a pursuit of career and prestige, and even with a third-class degree they could ensure both If they were clever enough they could make an aegrotat degree do as well But they also showed what a femme fatale Oxford or Cambridge could be for them</p>
<p>Max Muller at Oxford saw many of them, and in spite of being a champion of India and Indians he has not left a favourable account of them As he put it</p>
<p>The manners of young Indians when they arrive at Oxford are generally excellent, but they soon acquire what they consider English manners, rough and ready, bluff and blunt, and by no means an improvement on their own The same young man who at first enters your room with folded hands and a graceful salaam, will after a very short time walk in, sit down, stretch out his legs, and address you in the most familiar terms They imagine this is English</p>
<p>He continued</p>
<p>Even if they pass their examinations, I am afraid that some of them return to India not much improved by their English exile The worst of it is that they often return desillusionne At first everything English is grand and perfect in their eyes, an Oxford degree is the highest goal of their ambition But when they have obtained it, chiefly by learning by heart, they make very light of it And this making light of it is soon applied to other things English also, which they hear constantly criticized or abused, particularly in the newspapers and parliament, so that they often leave England better informed, it may be, but hardly better affected towards the Government which they are meant to serve</p>
<p>^ Max Muller had some understanding of what rankled in the mmds of these Indian students It was the absence of personal relations with their English fellow-students</p>
<p>At Oxford [he wrote] they find it very hard to make friends among the better class of undergraduates Most of our undergraduates come from public schools, and have plenty of friends of their own If they are asked to be kind to any of the Indian students, all they can do, or really</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[207]]</p>
<p>be expected to do, is to invite them once or twice to a breakfast party They have hardly any interests in common with them, and anything like friendship is out of the question</p>
<p>He continued sadly ‘The present state of things is certainly discouraging, particularly as it seems impossible to suggest any real remedy 5 The Indians themselves made it worse by setting down this natural canalization of social intercourse to racial and political pride and treating it as conscious apartheid Moreover, they themselves had a sense of guilt They felt keenly that they had come to promote their own worldly interests by serving a foreign government, and therefore the more thoroughgoing their interested association, the more rancorous was their vicarious disaffection Yet the same men, when they went back to India and enjoyed their prosperity and prestige, showed an arrogance to their own countrymen which was not less than that of the English rulers This internal dichotomy almost predetermined that Indians from Oxford and Cambridge should be sterile adventurers incapable of exercising any influence on the life and culture of their own people In fact, some of the most brilliant Indian students of Oxford turned out to be the worst careerists in their country Even Nehru failed to impinge on Indian life and behaviour with his ideas</p>
<p>Max Muller also had a concept of a possible Imperial role for Oxford and Cambridge, but in its combination of vision with realism it was in complete contrast to the pretentious and artificial idea which lay behind the Rhodes Scholarships He did not believe that the peculiarly English traits and outlooks could be imposed on aliens simply by giving them an opportunity to pass through the two universities In fact, in a letter written to the Duke of Argyll when he became Secretary of State for India in 1868, Muller said</p>
<p>India can never be anglicized, but it can be remvigorated By encouraging a study of their own ancient literature, as part of their education, a national feeling of pride and self-respect will be reawakened among those who influence large masses of the people A new national literature may spring up, impregnated with Western ideas, yet retaining its native spirit and character A new national literature will bring with it a new national and a new moral vigour</p>

<p>Historically, this was exactly what happened in the second half of the nineteenth century in Bengal, but it did not come about by</p>
<p>[[208]]</p>
<p>bringing Indians to Oxford and Cambridge Max Muller’s prescription was to give the desired education in India by training Englishmen at Oxford to play their educational role there effectively He saw the fulfilment of British rule in India in this educational mission, which was really a task of cultural proselytization He had put forward the idea as early as 1856, in a letter written to Bunsen m which he said &lsquo;After the last annexation the territorial conquest of India ceases — what follows next is the struggle in the realm of religion and of the spirit, in which, of course, centres the interests of the nations ’ He repeated the idea in different words to the Duke of Argyll &lsquo;India has been conquered once, but India must be conquered again, and that second conquest should be a conquest by education ’</p>
<p>He added in the same letter that as a result of Western education a class of young Indians had already risen in Bengal, who were known as Young Bengal and who were ready to play their part in this movement of cultural proselytization, because they were the &lsquo;product of English ideas grafted on the native mind’ He informed the Duke that Englishmen in India were always finding fault with this Young Bengal, but set down his view that in spite of their faults they had promise, observing shrewdly that ‘their faults were apparent everywhere, but their good qualities were naturally hidden from the eyes of careless observers’ Then he gave the example of a young Bengali who had just published a book on his travels in Europe, in which he said that &lsquo;if it was the will of Providence that a nation would have a yoke on its neck the yoke of the English was the least galling’ Max Muller also quoted to the Duke the words in which this young man summed up the achievement of the English people m India, and at the same time put his finger on the weak spot of the British attitude towards Indians .</p>
<p>Nothing less than British phlegm, and imperturbability, and constancy, and untiring energy could have steadily prosecuted the task of consolidating the disjointed masses of India, and casting her into the mould of one compact nation They want but ‘high thoughts seated in a heart of courtesy 5 to attach us to their rule, with a feeling of loyalty that, not merely playing round the head, should come near to the heart</p>
<p>On this Muller commented . &lsquo;A society leavened by such men will make it possible for the Government to save hundreds and thou-</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[209]]</p>
<p>sands in soldiers and policemen, and millions in wars and suppression of rebellions *</p>
<p>Muller had also thought out how the emergence of such a class of Indians could be promoted It was that young Englishmen should have the kind of education in English universities which would make them capable of playing their cultural role by giving them on the one hand intellectual competence and knowledge and, on the other, sympathy and understanding for the Indian people The very first step which had to be taken to realize this purpose was to create a school of Indian languages in the universities His long campaign to establish such an institution and to introduce the study of Oriental languages in England, has been described in the previous chapter</p>
<p>But Max Muller’s concept of a cultural mission in India was never taken seriously in England, either in its doctrmal or in its practical aspect On the contrary, young Englishmen went to serve m India in ignorance of the country and with contempt for the people The only corrective to that situation, which was provided more by the circumstances than by any conscious perception of the problem, was to bring young Indians over to Oxford or Cambridge, give them an English veneer, and sterilize them It was an application of the idea which afterwards Rhodes consecrated with his money. This was a negation of true imperialism, and it is no wonder that the country named after Rhodes and the country where he achieved his spectacular success have both become the most unequivocal symbols of the failure of British imperialism</p>
<p>However, one must not judge the imperial aspect of reformed Oxford by its expression among the colonial British and the Indians educated at Oxford and Cambridge. It had a higher and more imposing aspect, as shown by men such as Curzon and Milner who were more authentic Oxford men than Rhodes Long before either of them Max Muller had found himself wishing that the lure of the Indian Civil Service had not brought Indians to Oxford, and that they had remained in their own country to serve it as scholars and thinkers.</p>
<p>In spite of all this an Oxford Magna did emerge out of the reforms, between which and the larger political and imperial existence of the English people there was a very close nexus Oxford, too, became proudly conscious of the relationship In the earlier stages of reform the most majestic political personality moulded by</p>
<p>[[210]]</p>
<p>Oxfoid, Gladstone, was hounded out, but with the completion of reform the university took pride in noting the fact that in the last year of the nineteenth century there were ten Oxford men in a Cabinet presided over by its Chancellor</p>
<p>Along with this however the old Oxford Parva was not only allowed to survive, but was even infused with a new vitality Its scholarship, speculations and art of living were made more active and fervid All activities of the mind were recreations pursued and valued more for the sense of self-realization than for the contribution they made to knowledge or thought Nowhere was the Latin saying Abeunt studia in mores (study fulfils itself in a manner of living) better illustrated than in this little Oxford, Oxford Parva sed Apia There settled on its grey stones some light from far away Fiesole and Sienna The men who represented this Oxford were figures like T H Greene, F H Bradley, Walter Pater, to mention only a typical few</p>
<p>The scholarly and speculativ e creations of this Oxford enlivened, enriched, and sustained mental life in the outside world, even including India But in its own existence they were only parerga aeademica y incidental music at a banquet The value of the education which Oxford gave was frankly recognized by all , but anyone who knew anything about scholarship, learning, science and speculative thought, also knew that love of knowledge for its own sake was the last thing fostered by new Oxford among its students On this point foreigners, natives and domiciled foreigners were all agreed Renan observed that a minor German university with its poor and uncouth professors did more for the human spirit than the aristocratic university of Oxford with its princely revenues, its magnificent buildings, its opulent style of living and its idle fellows</p>
<p>Pattison, whose one positive passion in life was the pursuit of learning and who as reformer had before his eyes the vision of Oxfoid as a home of higher research and advanced learning, became a confirmed misanthrope when reform was at last fully under way He did not deny that Oxford efficiently performed its function as a great national lycee But this was precisely the Oxford he disliked and disapproved of To him this function showed a preference for the ‘lower states of education of which all men do or can partake’, as against the superior education which a university professes to administer In his exasperated moments he called this Oxford a cramming shop</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[211]]</p>
<p>Max Muller, who was associated with the reformers from the beginning but would not take any active part in the movement because he was a foreigner, very soon became disappointed with the outcome of the reforms Even in 1855 he wrote &lsquo;Oxford is in a sad condition , the reform has done nothing, and we are worse off than before Gladstone’s Bill has introduced a complicated and impractical system, which suffocates all proposals for the better . What remains therefore is nothing but the coffee-grounds which nobody desires to have — clergymen without a parish and scholars without scholarship 1 ’</p>
<p>Thirteen years later, on October 27, 1S68, he spoke no less emphatically in his inaugural lecture delivered as the new Professor of Comparative Philology</p>
<p>Noblesse oblige [he declared] applies to Oxford at the present moment more than ever, when knowledge for its own sake and a chivalrous devotion to studies which command no price in the fair of the world, and lead to no place of emolument in Church or State, are looked down upon and ridiculed by almost everybody</p>
<p>There is no career in England at the present time for scholars and students No father could honestly advise his son, whatever talent he might display, to devote himself exclusively to classical, historical, or physical studies The few men who still keep up the fair name of England by independent research and new discoveries in the fields of political and natural history, do not always come from our universities , and unless they possess independent means, they cannot devote more than their leisure hours, left by their official duties in Church or State, to the prosecution of their favourite studies</p>
<p>This, he declared, neither ought to be nor need be, for if only twenty men at Oxford and Cambridge had the will everything was ready for reform and the restoration of the ancient glory of Oxford In 1878, a writer giving a portrait of Max Muller in Contemporary Portraits , New Series, No 10, quoted the passage from his inaugural lecture and explained why it was so, as he saw it &lsquo;The reason,’ he said, &rsquo;that meets these pertinent queries is the shameful one that Oxford is of the world and that in the world’s ways the ideally best must hide its shamefaced beauty before the power of position, the scorn of vested interests, the laziness of the luxurious, the intrigues of self-seekers, the worshippers of material prestige .*</p>
<p>Strong as this was, it was also the view of the life and aspirations</p>
<p>[[212]]</p>
<p>of the Oxford dons held by the town, which had very little respect for the gown As it happened, the university and the colleges were themsehes responsible for creating such notions They had refused to disclose the facts about their revenues to the Commission of 1850, and, as a result, speculation was rife about their hidden and hoarded wealth It was the Cleveland Commission of 1872, which, in its report published in 1874, for the first time fully revealed the extent of the wealth and properties of the university and the colleges, and show ed that they were neither as wealthy as many had supposed, nor careless as landowners But great landowners they still were, the university being the junior partner and the colleges collectively the semor The income of the two was classified under six heads (1) Lands, (2) house property, (3) tithe rent charges, (4) other rent charges, such as free farm rents and fixed charges, (5) stocks, shares, and other securities , (6) receipts from fines, tuition, minerals, etc Overwhelmingly, the money came from landed property, of which the university had 7,684 acres, and the colleges jointly 184,764 acres The total income of the university was £47,000, of wdiich £29,000 came from property The total income of the colleges was £363,000, of which £280,000 came from the same source</p>
<p>The authorities of the university and the colleges showed themselves as very competent managers, and never buried their material talents Mark Pattison, with all his love of learning and absorption m mental life, was not less attentive to the properties of Lincoln Jowett, for all his cherubic looks, was an astute business man both as master and as Vice-Chancellor Max Muller has left a most illuminating account of the business flair of an Oxford don and clergyman, Dr Bull, Canon and Bursar of Christ Church</p>
<p>A well-known banker had for years been handling the money of Christ Church, and no one suspected him One day, however, Dr Bull invited him to dinner, and he was struck by the very pious and orthodox remarks the banker made, which he thought suited a Canon of Christ Church more than a wealthy and worldly banker from London Without saying a word Dr Bull went to London the next day, drew out all the money of the college, and the day after, to the dismay of all London, the bank failed All the other depositors lost their money, but not Christ Church</p>
<p>But in the pre-reform days, that is, in the days of the Don Logs, the scramble was not indecorous, for the distribution of patronage</p>
<p>OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>and preferment was controlled by a fixed procedure and confined to an oligarchy without reference to merit But the reforms which dragged merit into the question of preferment, at once promoted the scramble by bringing into existence a class of pushing Don Storks and giving respectability to their monetary ambitions The first appearances of the factionalism were seen in the rejection of Pattison’s claim to the Rectorship of Lincoln in 1851 and of Jowett’s to the Mastership of Balliol in 1854 Max Muller was also to suffer from it, as will be related later For a decade or so the tactics for denying money to a person not acceptable to the dominating caucus was to fasten the odium theologicum on him But as time passed the religious or dogmatic narrowness declined, and the scramble became a tussle for money pure and simple</p>
<p>Two men, above everybody else, stood out among the leading personalities of the reforming Oxford in the latter half of the nineteenth century, and they represented both its bright and dark sides They were, of course, Jowett and Pattison No one living at Oxford in those days could be unaware of their overwhelming presence Jowett provided its son et lumiere , and Pattison its thunder and lightning Moreover no one, judging them contemporaneously or in historical retrospect, could deny that they had their unquestionable, though particular, greatness and genius But no one could also fail to be conscious that both had traits of character which repelled or alienated. No theologian to my knowledge has described what the fallen angels were like when they had rebelled and been thrown out of heaven Jowett and Pattison could give a very good idea of them, the first as Belial and the second as Moloch Both showed themselves at Oxford as seraphim who had qualified for hell „</p>
<p>It is curious that of the two Pattison should, in the final summingup, turn out to be the better scholar Jowett was the best boy at St Paul’s, won the Balliol scholarship, was elected fellow as an undergraduate and took a first Pattison, on the contrary, never went to school and was taught by his father at home, got a second class at Oxford, and after failing to be elected fellow at Oriel, University and Balliol, got a Lincoln fellowship as a sort of consolation prize Yet he could despise Jowett’s scholarship. But Mark Pattison’s poor opinion of Jowett’s scholarship was both unfair and irrelevant” Scholarship is a matter of temperament Pattison had that, while Jowett did not Jowett was essentially and above all a pedagogue and a moralist. What Jowett sought to do was to pour</p>
<p>[[214]]</p>
<p>on to the three mam interests of nineteenthcentury Englishmen, politics, money and religion, the spikenard of a refurbished Hellenism, which might be called Victorian neo-Platomsm, but which was of course very much more superficial Jowett was called ‘Master’ by men and women of fashion, and the Master he remained</p>
<p>Pattison could see with perfect clearness where he and Jowett differed as to the end of university education ‘The separation between Jowett and myself’, he wrote, ‘consists in a difference upon the fundamental question of university politics — viz , Science and Learning v School keeping ’</p>
<p>Pattison’s defects of character were obvious, and therefore clever novelists could satirize him easily Swinburne broke out with the epigram that Pattison was a ‘morally and spiritually typical and unmistakable ape of the Dead Sea’ Jowett’s failings, on the other hand, were extremely insidious, and could hardly be perceived by outsiders unless they were almost cynically percipient Also, he had the intelligence and moderation to utilize them for advancing his career rather than letting them damage it He was a flatterer of the aristocracy and of people of fashion</p>
<p>There could be no doubt whatever but that Pattison was the greater man He achieved at its highest level the personality of a man endowed with great intellectual power and with a demoniac passional potential, but without the faculty of positive and disinterested love which is the Christian cantas In its default, he was bound to arrive at the state of mind which proclaimed itself in an invincible repugnance for all action He feared moral and religious enthusiasm, for he knew not where it might lead He distrusted religion, and set down in his memoirs that ‘religion is a good servant, but a bad master’</p>
<p>In nothing else was the desiccation of Mark Pattison shown more characteristically than in his intense desire for love and his failure to get it, with one exception He wanted love, but never realized that love cannot be had without loving, without shedding all egoism Pattison in everything was an uninhibited egoist, and even his affection for Meta Bradley was a projection of his self-love flattered by the adoration of a weak woman His wife described her horror of his last days in the following words ‘Let not my last days be like his * The moral rum is awful ’</p>
<p>Jowett was the opposite He inspired affection and could also show</p>
<p>OXFORD-[[215]]</p>
<p>affection But the interchange was superficial, for he distrusted passion and always employed that word in a bad sense Therefore, over his puntamsm, which was both fierce and narrow, he succeeded in laying a coat of unctuousness, which made worldlings look up to him for moral inspiration and guidance But there was also no doubt that his moral sense was fundamentally right His intellectual capacity and moral sensitiveness were such that one could not easily perceive that he was an adventurer V ery few adventurers in the world have taken an adventurer’s life to a higher level, morally and intellectually</p>
<p>There is one test which is dependable in judging the personality of any Oxford man in the latter half of the nineteenth century, and that is his attitude to John Henry Newman, the disinherited among the great sons of Oxford Jowett and Pattison agreed in substance over him, but in a wholly different spirit After reading the life of Newman, in 1891 Jowett wrote to Margot Tennant (later Asquith)</p>
<p>Considering what he really was, it is wonderful what a space he has filled in the eyes of mankind In speculation he was habitually untruthful and not much better in practice His conscience had been taken out, and the Church put in its place Yet he was a man of genius, and a good man in the sense of bemg disinterested Truth is very often troublesome, but neither the world nor the individual can get on without it</p>
<p>Mark Pattison also believed, like Jowett, that Newman did not care for truth apart from dogma, but he showed no personal disrespect for him He had called Newman &lsquo;Master’, and to the end he called him that When Pattison was dying, Newman wrote to him expressing a wish to see him He at once agreed, though his antirelxgious cynicism attributed a motive to the visit After it was over Pattison wrote Tt was not all personal regard, but the hope, however slight, that I might still be got over in my last moments ’ Though cynical, the comment was not disrespectful to Newman personally Newman did have that hope, but it could not be dishonourable in a man of faith to hope to bring back to the fold a follower who had strayed from it</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that in the unfolding of their careers both the men remained true to their origins, commercial and clerical Jowett remained throughout the successful businessman, and</p>
<p>Pattison the unsuccessful cleric 8</p>

<p>Between them they represented the new Oxford in its personal ambitions and in its consciously adopted educational role, though one gloated on success and the other almost exulted in failure There were, however, two others who kept up the spirit of old Oxford through the changing times, here again with contrasted results for themselves These men w ere Dr Pusey and Dean Liddell Pusey died fighting to the last for an Oxford in the service of religion Liddell adapted himself to the reformed Oxford very successfully, and even helped further reforms, but in spirit he remained true to old times</p>
<p>A very mistaken idea of Dr Pusey as an intolerant bigot was current among his latter-day contemporaries, and still survives Actually, in spite of his failure and indeed owing to that very defeat — for at Oxford only defeat could canonize a man to greatness — he was the only samt and hero in the Oxford of the late nineteenth century He was indeed uncompromising in what he regarded as true doctrine and its application To give only one instance of his intolerance, which came within Max Muller’s personal knowledge he refused to admimster the Holy Communion to Muller because he had not been confirmed by a bishop But he also helped Muller m his efforts to get the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit, and no one canvassed more energetically for him He met the Hindu reformer Keshub Chunder Sen, and though they had a long argument, they also parted as friends He also had the warmest sympathy for students in every branch of Oriental philology After Pusey’s death in 1882 Max Muller, who had considered him dangerous in early life, paid the most unqualified tribute to his greatness of character in a letter to The Times</p>
<p>In fact, Pusey was a true Christian in the very combination of intolerance and understanding. There is no greater misrepresentation of Christianity than to call it a religion of strength made perfect m weakness The modern conception of Christianity as a religion of degenerate compassion which enjoins tolerance for all human failings, crimes and perversions, is a grotesque distortion On the contrary, Christianity was merciful to the weak because it was so strong Pusey was a true Christian in that he condemned himself (not merely others) as a sinner</p>
<p>Pusey’s excessive sense of his own sinfulness may now seem horribly unnatural, but Christianity was never a religion for the natural man, whom it regarded as unregenerate man living in</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[217]]</p>
<p>original sin A conviction of sinfulness, however unfounded, was of the very essence of Christian faith and morality, and, as the biographers of Pusey point out, self-condemnation has come from St Augustine, St Francis of Assisi, St Vincent de Paul, John Bunyan, St Francois de Sales and John Wesley Pusey only continued that tradition It was strange that a man who was really angelic should consign himself to hell with only a slender hope that, justified by faith alone, he would be allowed to redeem himself there, whereas the two fallen angels, Pattison and Jowett, continued to strut and bask in the heaven that was Oxford But certainly Pusey’s self-torture was preferable to the moral complacence of Jowett, purred out to fashionable men and women, who saw in it a gilding of their worldly hedonism</p>
<p>It was in such a setting that Max Muller had to live his life at Oxford His reaction was a strange dichotomy of attraction and repulsion, as was perhaps unavoidable from the dual nature of Oxford The whole relationship can be illustrated by Muller’s relations with Jowett, which were symbolic They became friends very early, and in all the vicissitudes of Jowett’s career Muller sided with him He was on Jowett’s side when the latter brought theological troubles on himself, and by that association Muller also got into trouble And he expressed himself even more strongly when at one stage the proposal to increase Jowett’s salary as Regius Professor of Greek fell through</p>
<p>Yet there rankled in Muller’s mind some sense of grievance against Jowett, some dark suspicion of duplicity or disloyalty This came to a head early in 1876, at the time of the reconstitution of the terms of the Professorship of Comparative Philology Muller suspected Jowett of sitting on the fence, if not actually opposing the proposal After the matter had been settled in Muller’s favour and Jowett had supported him strongly, Muller wrote to Stanley that though he admitted Jowett had behaved well, he still could not quite forgive him He observed T cannot understand him Perhaps we make idols of our friends, and if they break we cannot bear it ’ There is finally the cool statement about Jowett in Muller’s autobiography, published after his death*</p>
<p>Jowett knew quite well, and he did not hesitate to say so, that to do much good in this world, you must be a very able and honest man, thinking of nothing else day and night; and he adds, ‘You must also be</p>
<p>[[218]]</p>
<p>a considerable piece of a rogue, having many reticences and concealments ’ Now Professor Jowett has certainly done some good work at Oxford, but if any one were to say that he also was a considerable piece of a rogue, what an outcry there would be among the sons of Balliol</p>
<p>The fact was that Max Muller by nature and upbringing was too simple a character to be quite at home at Oxford with all its complexity and sophistication He was uncomfortable with its subtle and often casuistical ethics, and on his part he repelled the more typically Oxford characters Mark Pattison, without knowing him intimately, gave the following psychological explanation of the failure of Muller to get the Boden Professorship Tt was due/ he said, &lsquo;first and chiefly, to his own unpopular manners and to the experience his own friends (including myself among the number) have had of his inability for real attachment We all knew that he only valued us so far as we could be of use to him 9</p>
<p>For Pattison to say that of Muller was almost scandalous Muller never came to know of Pattison’s opinion, but he knew his man He looked upon Pattison as the best-read man at Oxford, and added. &lsquo;Anywhere but at Oxford he would have grown into a Lessmg ’ None the less he also wrote to Bunsen &lsquo;Pattison is as reserved as ever, and trusts no one 5</p>
<p>Moreover, on account of his German-trained mmd he yearned for a kind of intellectual communication at Oxford which its society regarded as ‘shop-talk’ Even at the age of forty-three Max Muller showed a metaphysical proclivity which Oxford, with all its Hegelization, had no taste for Thus in 1867 Muller was complaining to Professor Bernays*</p>
<p>What I miss most here in Oxford is stimulating intercourse in literary and scientific circles That is entirely wanting, especially in my special branch of study Altogether the Englishman seems to me to have no interest for the ‘becoming&rsquo; or ‘growing 5 , it is all to be tangible and ready-made All dialectic is wanting in the true sense of the word However, there are deep shadows everywhere, and I do not want to forget the bnght sides of English life, and I am afraid that I should find it somewhat difficult to get accustomed again to the rather narrow German trousers</p>
<p>He was however very grateful to Oxford, and added in the same</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[219]]</p>
<p>letter that ‘here in Oxford, I must say, everything is done to make up for what has been done amiss’</p>
<p>Max Muller decided to solve the social problem of remaining at Oxford by following St Paul’s dictum about the world Thou shalt be in it, but not of it He tried to keep aloof from the incessant movement of wheels within wheels at Oxford for monetary and other worldly advantages Nor would he join the reforming movement actively, because he felt that his open participation in it would do harm because he was a foreigner, and of all foreigners a German For this he suffered personally However, 1 emaimng dependent on the academic community of Oxford for money and position he could not hope to be entirely free of its intrigues, rivalries, antipathies and partisanships</p>
<p>It is Muller’s involvement in the life that was the most typically Oxonian of all Oxford life which now has to be described It has already been seen how the delay in appointing him to the Taylorian Professorship had irked him But this post was not a university preferment, and in any case the appointment of a European as a lecturer on European languages was not likely to be resented So Max Muller had the Professorship easily The Greek language, however, was looked upon as a special prerogative of the Oxford dons After Liddell came to Christ Church as Dean in 1855, Muller discussed with him the Greek lexicon, the famous Liddell and Scott, and observed that, good as the dictionary was, its etymologies were mostly inaccurate Though Liddell was no student of comparative philology, he was broadminded enough to ask Muller to undertake the task of revising them All seemed settled between the two, when one day the Dean came to him, shrugged his shoulders, and said that the proposal had to be given up He did not explain the reason, though evidently he was very displeased</p>
<p>It was only in 1898, two years before his death, that Muller learned from an anonymous review that Scott was the man who had obstructed the proposal for revision Even then Max Muller would not believe it, because in his early years at Oxford Scott has shown great kindness and courtesy to him He had heard also that Scott was associated with those who were against him in connexion with the Boden Professorship But it is quite possible that Scott had lost all friendly feeling for Muller because he was a friend of Jowett, to whom Scott had been preferred as Master of Balliol Privately, Max Muller held a poor opinion of Scott, and in 1870 he wrote to his</p>
<p>[[220]]</p>
<p>wife T consider Scott as a thoroughly dishonest man, and yet he is respected by many people Who knows who is right ^</p>
<p>The next step in the advancement of Max Muller at Oxford was, however, a most gratifying experience for him In 1858 he was elected a Fellow of All Souls, an unprecedented honour for a foreigner at that time This was done at the instance of Henry Coxe, Librarian of the Bodleian and known as Bodley Coxe Coxe entertained a very warm friendship for Muller and, realizing that the status and home offered by the college would be a great help to him, discussed it with another friend, Sir Robert Herbert, and they joined in pressing upon the Fellows of All Souls the advisability of electing him under the special powers conferred by the Act of 1854 This was done, and Muller’s delight knew no bounds</p>
<p>A writer, after his death recalling Muller’s life at Oxford, observed that he never ceased to find an exquisite kind of amusement in his own position as a Fellow of All Souls Tor him, the self-devoted Stuhengelehrte , the youth of austere training and unworldly ideals, to have drifted into that fat paradise of the voluptuaries of learning struck him as a delightful joke on the part of Fate, and one which he frankly enjoyed seeing appreciated by others 5 To his mother Muller wrote &lsquo;The bells have been rung again for me in Oxford, for I have, quite unexpectedly, received a fellowship in All Souls College I had no idea of it, and the thing has excited great surprise. A fortnight ago I was asked if I should have any objection if I were elected, and the next day I was elected Why they elected me I have no idea, it is a great distinction 5</p>
<p>This unsolicited distinction and kindness evoked a sneaking kindness in Max Muller for the old unreformed All Souls which elected its Fellows as if they were members of a social club But he himself was elected under the new Ordinance which required that the Fellows should be chosen according to their merits.</p>
<p>At all events, he showed very little of the don as a new Fellow At the annual Gaudy on All Souls 5 Day he would become the German student again, and join with the somewhat tumultuous merriment of the younger fellows, and be induced to sing Gaudeamus tgitur</p>
<p>Max Muller’s next attempt to secure a higher income and position at Oxford, by obtaining the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit, ended in a complete failure This was a decisive turning point in his scholarly and intellectual life, and for this reason the episode has to</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT</p>
<p>be narrated fully But the story also illustrates the dark and bright Oxford which had become the setting of his life The election to this Professorship of Momer Williams instead of Max Muller in December i860 was an incident in the long struggle between the academic reformers and conservatives, in which the latter, after being defeated over the wider question of remodelling the university, won a startling incidental victory</p>
<p>The Professorship was endowed by LieutColonel Joseph Boden of the East India Company’s service, who had retired in 1807 and died in 1 81 1 He bequeathed all his property, valued roundly at .£25,000, ultimately to Oxford to found a Professorship of the Sanskrit Language, &lsquo;being of opinion that a more general knowledge and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language will be a means of enabling his countrymen to proceed in the conversion of the Natives of India to the Christian Religion, by disseminating a knowledge of the sacred scriptures amongst them, more effectually than all other means whatever’</p>
<p>The legacy came finally to Oxford at the death of Boden’s daughter at the age of mneteen, and after some litigation In 1832 one of the distinguished early English Sanskritists, Horace Hayman Wilson, was appointed to the post As its salary was between £goo to £1,000 a year and as it was tenable for life, it was looked upon as a very lucrative living at the disposal of the university Certainly competition for it would have been much more severe if it had not been reserved for a scholar in Sanskrit Thus it happened that over about a century the post had only three incumbents Wilson from 1832 to i860, Momer Williams from i860 to 1899, and Macdonnel from 1899 to 1927 Appointment to it was in the hands of the Convocation, which was to choose the candidate most fitted in its judgement to fulfil the post In January 1861 the Convocation had 3,786 members Thus the election to the Professorship had the character of a parliamentary election, and the candidates followed the same methods in contesting for the post</p>
<p>Wilson died on May 8, i860, and the notice of an election to be ‘holden 5 on December 7 next was issued on May 16 Max Muller immediately sent in his application with numerous testimonials, and so did Momer Williams Among those who recommended Muller were all the noted Orientalists of Europe of the age, dignitaries like the Bishop of Calcutta and Raja Radha r anta Deb in India, and many leading English ecclesiastical figures, including</p>
<p>[[222]]</p>
<p>Pusey, Keble, Church and Stanley The supporters of Momer Williams equalled in number those of Muller, and included many Bengali pundits, but they were not so distinguished For six months and more a vigorous election campaign was carried on, with manifestoes, handbills, letters to newspapers and, above all, personal canvassing by means of letters and word of mouth Muller had his committee, and Momer Williams had two, one at Oxford and the other in London In less than a month Muller was sick of the business</p>
<p>There is no doubt that, in a more or less conscious way, Max Muller had had his eyes on this post as the culmination of his career at Oxford and also as a secure means of pursuing his vocation of studying Sanskrit In any case, his friends and fellow-scholars had always expected that it would come to him in time</p>
<p>Before the election took place a supporter of Muller wrote to The Times that the difference between the two candidates was the &lsquo;difference between respectable and honourable proficiency, and the complete and masterful knowledge of the subject possessed by a rare genius and profound scholar, from whose authority on the subjects of Indian philology and philosophy there was no appeal in Europe 5 This was perfectly true in the light of contemporary reputation A French Sanskritist kept on declaring, in spite of what others were saying, that Muller’s defeat was impossible</p>
<p>But all this was irrelevant to the question of Muller’s election, which was to be swayed by a different consideration — the intention of the Founder The paradoxical aspect of the matter was that after the rejection of the intentions of the Founders in respect of the working of the whole university, the Convocation was being asked to respect the intention of a Founder in regard to one Professorship The question was thoroughly discussed During the election campam both Max Muller and Momer Williams circulated manifestoes explaining their respective views on the nature of the Professorship</p>
<p>Of these, Muller’s was the first and was dated September 3, i860 He said that if elected it would be his most obvious duty to give practical and daily teaching to those who wanted to learn or study Sanskrit, but he also pointed out that this alone would be ‘but a mean return for the liberality of the Founder of the Chair of Sanskrit’ He added that a Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford ought to lecture on (1) the history and literature of India; (2) the religion and philosophy of the Hindus, and (3) Comparative Philology He</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[223]]</p>
<p>thought that the Boden Professor should create a school of Sanskrit Scholarship and Comparative Philology at Oxford On the basis of such a definition of the functions of the Professorship, Momer Williams was ready to concede Muller’s superior claim unreservedly But was the definition right ? Williams began by saying that before applying for the post he had taken the first step of ascertaining what the requirements were for the Professorship in the exact words of the Founder, and he declared</p>
<p>Had I found plain instructions that the electors of the University were to search throughout Europe for the man most likely to secure a worldwide reputation for the Sanskrit Chair, I confess that I should have hesitated to prosecute my design But Colonel Boden thought more of aiding, by means of Sanskrit, the diffusion of Christianity in India than of promoting in all parts of the globe the fame of the Professorship The establishment of a school of European comparative philology and Indian history, mythology, and philosophy, would doubtless be attractive, but such a departure from the one object of the Founder and strict province of the Professorship would not, in my opinion, be justifiable</p>
<p>Then he went on to give an analysis of the contents and character of Sanskrit literature in order to show which branch of it was most important from the Founder’s point of view, and if in so doing he also showed that Max Muller’s special studies were irrelevant he was not to be blamed, for in what he said he was right</p>
<p>Williams pointed out that Sanskrit literature could be classified under three distinct periods and categories Of these the most ancient and the first was the Vedic literature, the second was made up of the six systems of Hindu philosophy and the entire collection of philosophical writings, and the third comprised the mass of the later literature, including the epics, secular poetry and prose, and sacred law The Vedic literature, he observed, was not the sacred writings used and studied by the contemporary Hindus, and did not constitute their scriptures in the sense that the Bible and the Koran were Christian and Muslim scriptures. Thus the Rig-Veda (Max Muller’s speciality) — which, Williams said, was bemg published at an expenditure of time, labour, money and erudition far greater than was ever bestowed on any edition of the Bible — was ‘a curious monument of a bygone worship, at which the missionary, more usefully engaged in studying the present condition of the Hindu</p>
<p>mind, would content himself with a rapid glance.’</p>
<p>8 *</p>
<p>[[224]]</p>
<p>The second class of books, the philosophical texts which Momer Williams did not know as well as Max Muller, were according to Williams writings of a very abstruse and mystical nature, which very few learned natives understood, and which a missionary needed to know nothing about beyond their leading principles</p>
<p>In contrast, it was the third class of Sanskrit books (of which he had better knowledge than Muller and on which he had done more work), which were the real Sanskrit scriptures, which every missionary must study if he wished to understand the natives of India and be understood by them Moreover, classical Sanskrit, in which these books were written and to which Momer Williams had devoted his linguistic studies, &lsquo;really lived and breathed in the current speech of the people’, though nominally dead So, if the missionary had to translate the Christian scriptures into the modern Indian languages, it was this classical Sanskrit which they had to know, and not Vedic Sanskrit, on which Max Muller was the leading authority of the age Finally, Momer Williams pointed out, Max Muller’s Sanskrit scholarship was of the Continental type, and not attractive to the English mmd He had felt that until the study of Sanskrit was in a manner anglicized, it would always be nauseous to the English palate &lsquo;Englishmen, 5 he explained, &lsquo;are too practical to study a language very philosophically 5 All these arguments, besides being patriotic, were also legitimate from the standpoint of the Boden Professorship as envisaged by Boden, a pious Colonel of the Indian Army.</p>
<p>If the contest between Max Muller and Momer Williams were confined to the airing of antithetical conceptions of the Professorship, it would have been a sharp academic competition, but not an election campaign of the parliamentary type, which is what it became From the beginning all the spices which make the curry that is a parliamentary election were put in it At the end of the campaign even the ideology of the Professorship was highly emotionalized, and the religious stake involved was explained to the electors m the following handbill distributed on behalf of Momer Williams</p>
<p>BODEN SANSKRIT PROFESSORSHIP A Sacred Tmst has been committed to the University of Oxford by the late COLONEL BODEN</p>
<p>Members of the Convocation in votmg for a Boden Professor must not overlook their obligation to use his Endowment primarily to carry out his expressed mtentions</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[225]]</p>
<p>What then is this primary object?</p>
<p>It is ‘to enable his Countrymen to proceed in the conversion of the Natives of India to the Christian Religion, by disseminating a knowledge of the Sacred Scriptures among them’</p>
<p>There are Two Candidates, with ample Testimonials</p>
<p>The Organs of Public Opinion have thought the contest not unworthy</p>
<p>of their notice</p>
<p>What then is the result ?</p>
<p>By common consent both are pronounced scholars of world-wide reputation</p>
<p>But one of them is specially and earnestly recommended to Convocation by a great number of our Countrymen in India itself These Englishmen , educated by him, grateful for his instruction, and personally attached to him, are a machinery existing ready to hand for the great work to be done</p>
<p>They have no Votes to give, but their voice from that distant land should ring in our ears and hearts</p>
<p>They know their man, they know the Natives, they are in daily communication with them Is it wise to disregard their opinion ?</p>
<p>The Professorship is not for Oxford alone It is not for ‘The Continent and America’</p>
<p>It is for India It is for Christianity</p>
<p>Let us then Vote for the man who is well-known and loved in India, and who, even by the voice of his opponents, is declared to be a trustworthy depositary of the Christian interests of a Christian Foundation</p>
<p>MA</p>
<p>At once Max Muller’s supporters issued a counterblast in almost the same words, but with tell-tale modifications, such as ‘By general consent one is pronounced a Scholar of world-wide reputation, the other a Scholar well known to his Friends and Pupils *</p>
<p>But even from the missionary point of view, both Dr Pusey and the Bishop of Calcutta wrote in favour of Muller Pusey informed Muller that at the time of the first appointment to the Professorship m 1832 the question of giving a direct missionary turn to the appointment had arisen, and as a voter he had then given weight to it On the final notices of the election which he forwarded, he wrote m his own hand. ‘Max Muller has already done more for the Gospel in India than any other Sanskrit scholar, by opening to the missionaries their [the Hindus’] sacred books *</p>
<p>The Bishop of Calcutta wrote among other things that ‘it would</p>
<p>[[226]]</p>
<p>be more fitting in my opinion for a great Christian University to place in its Sanskrit Chair the scholar who has made the Sanskrit scriptures accessible to the Christian missionary’ He gave leave to Muller to use his letter in any way he considered fit After the question of the intention of the Founder, there also arose the question of the wishes of the previous holder of the Professorship, as if the principle of apostolic succession was involved in the appointment Momer Williams had no difficulty in producing decisive proof of his testamentary right With his application he submitted the following letter written by Wilson shortly before his death</p>
<p>14 Upper Wimpole Street, April 21, i860</p>
<p>My dear Williams, I am quite incompetent to give you any hints for your industry, for I have been and am suffering dreadfully I am about to undergo an operation, and, as there is always a certain amount of risk in such an operation at my age, I recommend your being alive to the chance of a vacancy I always have looked to you as my successor, but you will have a formidable competitor in M Muller, not only for his celebrity, but personal influence However, if God be pleased, I may get over the trial, and for a few years more keep you in expectancy Yours ever affectionately,</p>
<p>H H Wilson</p>
<p>Though this was explicit, a friend of Max Muller’s, W S W. Vaux of the British Museum, at once raised the question whether Wilson could have meant what he said Vaux wrote</p>
<p>My dear Muller, I was a little surpnsed to read among Williams’s testimonials the short note from our late fnend, in which he states that he had always looked forward to his succeeding him in the Boden Professorship, whenever he should make a vacancy On many occasions — and especially on the last time (about two months since, in the East India House Library) when I had the pleasure of seeing h im — he stated that, in his judgement, you were the first Sansknt scholar in Europe I remarked that I was glad to hear him give so decided an opinion, as I and several others were naturally anxious that his successor at Oxford should be the fittest man we could procure To this he said, ‘You will be quite right if your choice should fall on Max Muller ’</p>
<p>But on balance it appeared that Wilson was for Williams Even as far back as 1830 Wilson had expressed his low opinion of German Sanskrit scholars and provoked a controversy with A W Schlegel.</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[227]]</p>
<p>The campaign also made full use of personal arguments in the manner of parliamentary elections, and in respect of them Muller was an easier target than Williams He was accused of intending to hold two professorships (the Taylonan and the Boden) at the same time , of not being an Englishman , of not being able to write English well, and of being irreligious To one of these alone he pleaded guilty, ‘that of not having been born in England, and having no right to the name of an Englishman’ But he added, ‘If, however, residence and work in the University give a right to the name of Oxfordman, I may, without presumption, be thought to have acquired some claim to that title ’ All the other charges he rejected totally, and especially the charge of being irreligious</p>
<p>As to his English, a friend (who remained unknown) wrote to The Times ‘Mr Max Muller’s English is perfect Many who have not heard the wonderful force and clearness of his public lectures must have read, without knowing it, some of his many contributions to periodical literature ’</p>
<p>At the very height of the campaign Muller was accused of misrepresenting Williams in his reply in The Times to the latter’s manifesto by misquoting ‘some of his statements in a manner prejudicial to his interests’ Max Muller, who was very sensitive to any charge of dishonesty, immediately submitted the matter to four distinguished members of the university, who reported as follows.</p>
<p>We the undersigned, having examined Mr Momer Williams’s Circular of October 12, and Mr Max Muller’s Letter of October 23, beg leave to state that we consider the charge brought against Mr Max Muller, in Mr Momer Williams’s Circular just issued, of having ‘misquoted’ Mr Momer Williams in a manner prejudicial to his interests, to be wholly unfounded</p>
<p>William Thomson, Provost of Queen’s,</p>
<p>E B Pusey, Regius Professor of Hebrew,</p>
<p>William Jacobson, Regius Professor of Divinity, Mountague Bernard, Chichele Professor of International Law and Diplomacy</p>
<p>But the game was not all one-sided, and at some moments Williams too must have felt both awkward and stung</p>
<p>There was for instance an attack on Momer Williams on the score of his incompetence on the external side of Sanskrit scholarship It was put about that he could not read a Sanskrit manuscript</p>
<p>[[228]]</p>
<p>To dispro\e that some evidence was produced, and to this Max Muller’s supporters replied as follows</p>
<p>The extracts given by the Master of University and Mr Medd merely prove that Mr Williams is able to recognize the letters of a Sanskrit MS when he can compare it with an existing text This is a kind of mechanical labour which is paid for at the public libraries at Pans and Berlin at the rate of half-a-crown an hour Mr Williams has yet to prove that he can take a Sanskrit author existing in MS only and give him to the world for the first time</p>
<p>From Williams’s side a complaint came that some of Muller’s supporters had improved on this charge in one of the circulars by putting this comment on a circular &lsquo;The eyes of Europe are on our election Shall we elect a man who is great as a Sanskrit scholar, philologist, and teacher, or one who cannot read a Sanskrit MS It was in this atmosphere of hustings that the election for the Professorship was held on December 7, i860 The voting was 833 for Momer Williams and 610 for Max Muller The defeat was a severe disappointment to Muller and his friends, and they all held that the scales were tipped against him on irrelevant personal, religious and political grounds Muller himself wrote to his mother ‘The opposite party made it a political and religious question, and nothing could be done against them All the best people voted for me, the Professors almost unanimously, but the vulgus profanum made the majority ’ His father-in-law expressed himself very strongly ‘I know not when I have felt more deeply for the trials of others or had more reason to admire patience and resignation to God’s will than in the spirit you have shown, in what I know to be a most severe trial and bitter disappointment But now that all is over, and I have time to think, I am inclined to believe that with such unscrupulous opponents we could not have won ’</p>
<p>But the noblest comfort for him came from Stanley</p>
<p>I have never experienced [he wrote] the peculiar trial under which you are suffering, but I believe, from my own bitter disappomtment on your behalf, I can feel what it is for you You will have many consolations, I need not dwell upon them But you must also give us the best consolation that we can have, and that is the assurance that we have not been mistaken in the high expectations we had formed of you You can still show that, although not Boden Professor, you are and will</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[229]]</p>
<p>remain the oracle of all who wish to know 7 the secrets of Indian literature and religion</p>
<p>Stanley, through sheer spiritual sympathy, had already anticipated the course Muller’s intellectual efforts were to take</p>
<p>After Max Muller’s death two friends wrote to his wife explaining the reason for his failure to get the Professorship One of them was Canon Farrar, who was a member of his committee Fie said that he was inclined to think that the opposition to him was not strictly religious or political, but it sprang from &rsquo;the Englishman’s dislike to an adopted son’ He added that Muller did &rsquo;not realize the stubborn fixedness of English and Oxford preference for an old Oxford man’ But the other informant, W B Gamlen, told Mrs Max Muller that on the strength of the version of the affair given to him by &lsquo;Tommy’ Sheppard of Exeter, who was one of the leaders of the Oxford Tories, the verdict was entirely political As he put it T should judge that the same opposition would have been offered to any candidate, whether an Englishman or foreigner, who could have been identified with the liberal, or Gladstoman party ’</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that both personal and public reasons lay behind Max Muller’s defeat</p>
<p>His next move to have a share in the flesh-pots of Oxford succeeded, though not without some characteristically Oxonian opposition In October 1865 Max Muller applied for the post of the Oriental Sub-Librarian at the Bodleian, finding that his friend Coxe, who was the Librarian, could not secure the services of any other Orientalist With the unammous consent of the curators his name was forwarded for consideration by the Convocation, and the date of the election was announced At once letters began to appear m the press against him and for another aspirant</p>
<p>A formal contradiction to some of the statements made was issued by Coxe himself as the Bodleian’s Librarian He asserted that &lsquo;it may be as well to correct three mis-statements which appear m the first of the letters now under circulation Professor Muller’s salary as Taylonan Professor is -£500, not &ldquo;more than j£6oo” He has resigned the Exammership for the Indian Civil Service. His labours m editing the Vedas , so far from being &ldquo;well paid”, entail on him a considerable pecumary sacrifice ’</p>
<p>However, this time Muller was elected, and he enjoyed the work very much. But the double work proved too much for his health,</p>

<p>and he resigned the sub-librarianship after about a year and a half, In 1868 the university on its own initiative recognized the merits of Max Muller in a striking manner It abolished the Taylonan Professorship of Modem European Languages, and created in its place expressly for him a new chair of Comparative Philology on a higher salary This was the first professorship created by the university itself All the previous professorships were established either by royal benefactions or private endowments This relieved Muller of the duty of lecturing on the European languages, and left him free to pursue his own subject</p>
<p>For the next eight years Max Muller’s life and career at Oxford ran smoothly But at the end of 1875 he himself raised a storm about his career at Oxford, and on December 1 sent in his resignation of the Professorship of Comparative Philology to the Vice-Chancellor At the same time he also printed the letter of resignation in a circular, and distributed it so that his friends, both inside and outside the umversity, might know why after long consideration he had taken the step His mam and declared reason was that he wanted leisure to pursue his Indian and Sanskritic studies In his letter of resignation he said that he had to choose between Sanskrit and Comparative Philology, and he repeated that explanation in a personal letter to the Duke of Albany, one of Queen Victoria’s sons</p>
<p>If I had continued to discharge my duties as Professor of Comparative Philology, I should have had to surrender my Sanskrit studies altogether Were I Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford, nothing would have drawn me away from this, in many respects, delightful place , but in order to concentrate my powers, and to do something at least before it is too late, I see no choice but to give up my pleasant position here, and retire to some quiet town in Germany</p>
<p>None of his friends questioned the reasonableness of his decision on this ground, though all of them regretted it As soon as the news spread, letters began to pour in from all parts of the world, and even from India</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Muller was sincere in giving this reason for his resignation But there was much more behind it than was publicly stated For some years he had been feeling a very strong emotional revulsion from Oxford, and for a few months before he had actually decided to leave it he had written quite frankly to his</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[231]]</p>
<p>intimate friends about his dissatisfaction For instance, on August 22 he wrote to Stanley</p>
<p>I think my time in England is nearly up I doubt whether I ought to stay longer I am only tolerated at Oxford, allowed to help when I am wanted, but never helped myself when I want help If I had worked m Germany as I have worked for twenty-frve years in England, my position would be very different Here I am nobody in the University, and when I see how I am treated, I really feel sometimes ashamed of myself, not for my own, but for my wife’s sake</p>
<p>He felt he was at Oxford only on sufferance That this mood was also’ behind his resignation he admitted to his friend George von Bunsen, son of his old patron and helper, in a letter written in January 1876, in which he said ‘I will tell you viva voce why I have finally made up my mind to leave Oxford Clerical intrigues and petty jealousies, alas* were partly the reason ’</p>
<p>Even this was not the whole story What brought his sense of grievance against Oxford to a head and finally induced him to act was a particular personal matter — the decision of the Hebdomeda! Council to put up the name of Momer Williams to the Convocation for the honorary degree of d c l This was the only time in his whole career that Max Muller acted from personal pique, which showed that though intellectually he had outgrown his disappointment over the Boden Professorship, it still rankled in his mmd emotionally The decision to give the degree to Momer Williams was in itself an exhibition of the mores of academic Oxford Towards the end of the summer term of 1875 the friends of Williams in the Council applied to it to propose a decree which would enable him to have the formal degree of dcl without passing the examination for it The Council agreed and put forward a draft decree of exoneration As soon as it was published in the University Gazette the University Professor of Law made a solemn remonstrance that such a step would overthrow the whole fabric of legal studies which had been laboriously erected and by which an Oxford degree in law had been recognized by the Inns of Court If, he said, this degree was now conferred without an examination on a person ignorant of law the university would stultify itself But this argument, the Law Faculty added, did not apply to an honorary dcl, because it was well known that the honour was conferred annually on all sorts of persons and implied no legal qualifications in the recipient</p>
<p>[[232]]</p>
<p>The Council admitted the force of the argument and cancelled the session of the Convocation Williams&rsquo;s friends at once declared that this v ould be regarded as a stigma on him, for all the world had come to know that a degree was intended, and they even said that the stigma would be out of all proportion to the distinction which the degree would have given him Then the Council decided to propose the honorary degree of dcl, and proceeded with the matter This was regarded as a personal slight by Max Muller, and at the beginning of November he told his friends that he was going to resign</p>
<p>At this juncture his friends to a man showed themselves to be his real friends All of them disapproved of his decision, though they were ready to consider his other and mam motive, securing greater leisure for his work His brother-in-law Walrond wrote strongly to him T don&rsquo;t think you have any idea what a bad effect it would have For one man who would give you credit for indignation in a sacred cause, the cause of real learmng against the shallow pretence of it, a hundred would accuse you of petty personal jealousy And what a triumph your enemies will have then 1 &rsquo; Stanley wrote Tf you have on general grounds determined that you ought to pass your remaining years (and, oh* may they be many!) in Germany, much as I shall regret it I shall have nothing to say against it But that you should leave Oxford on the ground that an undeserved honour has been bestowed on Momer Williams seems to be both insufficient in itself and unjust to yourself 9 Dean Liddell, as soon as he heard about Max Muller&rsquo;s intention from Rolleston, wrote to him*</p>
<p>It grieves me much to hear you say that in M really contemplates resignation It appears to me that he, at once, greatly overrates the importance of the thing itself and greatly underrates his own position and character . . I am as sure that it will not occur to anyone that any slur will be cast on in M because the Council has rashly and undeservedly lavished an empty honour on in W MM stands far too high If, on the other hand, he should resign, I know my countrymen well enough to feel sure that he will be generally blamed and that his conduct will be set down to petulance You and I would feel too much interested in him not to dread this for his sake and to wish it averted, if averted it can be</p>
<p>A few days later Liddell wrote to Muller himself in the same</p>
<p>OXFORD—[[233]]</p>
<p>vein, and urged him to put off the resignation even if it were on general grounds Other friends also wrote to him All this showed that Muller’s fancy that he was only tolerated at Oxford was due to his own temperament which created these passing fits of impatience Anyhow, when he did resign on the general ground of work, they all set about doing something for him which would enable him to pursue his vocation without being encumbered by the duties of the Professorship The idea was to relieve him of the burden of lecturing on Comparative Philology by giving him a Deputy who would do that work, and to give him the status of a Professor Emeritus Even Lord Salisbury, as Secretary of State for India, took up the matter, and on January 27 Liddell wrote to Muller T have just received a “private” letter from Lord Salisbury, in which he expresses a warm desire on the part both of himself and of the India Council that you may be induced to remain at Oxford and in which he says that there “seems to be no objection in principle to the India Council co-operating with the University to incur the cost of publishing the ‘Indian Works’ which are mentioned in your list” ’ He also informed Muller that on Monday next he hoped to bring forward a proposal which might not be unsatisfactory to him This proposal was put into the form of a decree to be approved by the Convocation on February 15 and circulated by the Vice-Chancellor on January 31, 1876 It ran as follows</p>
<p>Whereas it is expedient to allow Professor in Muller to devote himself without interruption to the studies on the Ancient Literature of India which he has hitherto prosecuted with so much success and with so much honour to the University; In a CONVOCATION to be holden on Tuesday, February 15, at Two o’clock, the following form of Decree will be submitted to the House — ‘That the provisions of Statt Tit IV, Sect 1, 37, cl 3 be suspended, and that the Electors proceed to the nomination of A Deputy to be approved by the ViceChancellor, and the Deputy shall receive one half of the salary of the present Professor 5</p>
<p>Even so the author of Alice in Wonderland brought into play against the proposal the devastating logic exhibited in his fantasy He said that the deputy would be the real professor, and the retiring Professor would really get a pension, that the two were wholly independent questions , that the university should be able to provide the pension without mulcting the real professor of half of his</p>
<p>[[234]]</p>
<p>income All this, he said, he was writing in the interest of the unknown future holder of the Chair, though also in the interest of Max Muller, ‘for surely the very proposal to invite the new Professor to do the work for half the present salary, is to say, by implication, that the work has been hitherto overpaid — against which suspicion I, for one, desire to record my protest’</p>
<p>But the Convocation found the logic — sound as it was — unpersuasive, and the decree was carried, Jowett spoke in favour of it, and Liddell made a reasoned appeal in a long speech, with an eloquent peroration</p>
<p>Other Governments have acknowledged Professor Max Muller’s great achievements, the French Institute several 3^ ears ago elected him a Foreign Member, the Royal Academy of Turin paid him the same honour, and made him one of a distinguished six, the others being Cousin, Thiers, Bockh, Mommsen, and Grote He received the Cross of the Order of Merit from the German Emperor two years ago, along with von Moltke England has been behindhand Let Oxford by a unanimous vote today do something to repair this backwardness , not for his sake, but for our own, I ask it Let us keep him if we can, how we can, while we can</p>
<p>Max Muller was informed of the decision and wrote to the ViceChancellor in the most grateful terms, saying that he looked forward with great satisfaction to spending the remaimng years of his life at Oxford *</p>
<p>On hearing of it Froude wrote gladly. ‘My dear Max,</p>
<p>Two words only to express my hearty delight that all is well settled and that we are to be spared the dishonour of losing you 9 And just as Mohere said that la comedie ftmt par un petit ballet qm avoit ete prepare, the University Musical Club sent Max Muller the following invitation and message</p>
<p>The President ventures to invite Professor Max Muller’s attention to this evening’s programme, and to express to him the very great pleasure it would give the Club if he were able to be present this evening</p>
<p>* The post of Deputy Professor went to Archibald Henry Sayce, in A , at the time Fellow of Queen’s, an Orientalist and philologist, who became a leading Assynologist later The salary of the Professorship was £600 a year So the Deputy got £300</p>
<p>OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>At the same time he wishes to congratulate the Professor most heartily on the result of yesterday’s Convocation, and to express his great regret that anyone should have thought it their duty to oppose the proposition of the Council The programme will include Mozart’s Clarinet Quintet,</p>
<p>Beethoven’s Trio for Clarinet, piano, and violoncello,</p>
<p>Beethoven’s Sonata (G mm ) for piano and violoncello,</p>
<p>Beethoven’s arrangements of Scotch songs with string accompaniment. (Violoncello, Herr Daubart )</p>
