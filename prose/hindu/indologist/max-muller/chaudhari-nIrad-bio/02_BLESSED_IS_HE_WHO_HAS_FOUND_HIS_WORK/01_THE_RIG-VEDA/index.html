  <p>Chapter I</p>
<p>THE RIG-VEDA</p>
<p>It took Max Muller five years of continuous labour, which was partly mechanical drudgery, to complete the editing and printing of only the first volume of his edition of the Rig-Veda To understand the spirit and motivation of this project as well as his interest in the wider field of Sanskrit literature as a whole, it is necessary to take note of a basic contrast , that which existed between the German and English attitudes towards India in his young days This is essential because in his own position there was an amalgamation of the two He began as a purely German Indophile and Indologist, and soon assumed the roles in their British form, without however losing his original affiliation and inspiration</p>
<p>Generally speaking India attracted Continental Europeans, especially the Germans, and repelled the British This difference persisted even down to the last quarter of the nineteenth century For instance, when Sir Henry Maine in 1875 delivered the Rede Lecture before the University of Cambridge on ‘The Effects of Observation of India on Modern European Thought’, he began by remarking that in speaking on a subject connected with India he would under ordinary circumstances preface what he had to say with an apology But the proverbial dullness attributed to Indian topics by Englishmen, he continued, did not reflect any particular credit on the latter, nor was it felt by the learned classes in any other country Then he described the situation on the Continent.</p>
<p>No one can observe the course of modern thought and enquiry on the Continent, and especially Germany, without seeing that India, so far from being regarded as the least attractive of subjects, is rather looked upon as the most exciting, as the freshest, as the fullest of new problems and of the promise of new discoveries The fervour of enthusiasm which glows in the lines written by the greatest of German poets when the dramatic genius of the Hindoos first became known to him through the translation of Sakuntala , seems to have scarcely abated in the scholars of our day who follow philological studies and devote themselves to the new branches of investigation constantly thrown out by the sciences of Comparative Philology and Comparative Mythology No</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>one can avoid seeing that their view of India affects in some degree their view of England, and the community, which is stigmatised more systematically on the Continent than it is perhaps aware, as a nation of shopkeepers, is thought to have had a halo of romance spread around it by its great possession</p>
<p>Seven years later, in 1882, Max Muller said the same thing, again at Cambridge, when delivering a course of lectures on India In England, he told his audience, a study of Sanskrit, and of the ancient poetry, the philosophy, the laws and the art of India was</p>

<p>(See page 140)</p>
<p>THE RIG-[[125]]</p>
<p>looked upon at best as curious, but was considered by most people as useless and tedious, if not absurd Then he drew the contrast</p>
<p>In France, Germany and Italy, even in Denmark, Sweden and Russia, there is a vague charm connected with the name of India One of the most beautiful poems in the German language is the Weisheit des Brahmanen , , the ‘Wisdom of the Brahman 5 , by Ruckert, to my mind more rich in thought and more perfect in form than even Goethe&rsquo;s West-osthcher Divan A scholar who studies Sanskrit in Germany is supposed to be initiated in the deep and dark mysteries of ancient wisdom, and a man who has travelled in India, even if he has only discovered Calcutta, or Bombay, or Madras, is listened to like another Marco Polo In England a student of Sanskrit is generally considered a bore, and an old Indian Civil Servant, if he begins to describe the marvels of Elephanta or the Towers of Silence, runs the risk of producing a count-out</p>
<p>This was in every way natural, for the German and British involvements in India were of wholly different kinds The German interest was spontaneous, the product of a combined emotional and intellectual urge created by the Romantic Movement, whereas the British was forced, a by-product of the establishment of British political power In other words, the German interest was ideological and imaginative, the British practical and objective For the Germans the knowledge of India was an ingredient in a process of becoming , by the acquisition of which they wanted to make their European personality deeper and fuller They felt that India had thoughts and feelings which were different as well as complementary to theirs The Englishman would not even consider the possibility that anything from India could enrich his English personality His problem was what to do with India, an unwanted, troublesome and largely unintelligible possession for which his country was becoming politically responsible</p>
<p>The Romantic Drang nach Osten , with India as its particular goal, refurbished the old Graeco-Roman notion of ex Onente lux , which tempted even Plotmus to think of going to India, and this urge proclaimed its faith quite early and explicitly Friedrich Schlegel declared, even before he knew Sanskrit himself, that it was in the East that the Europeans must look for the highest Romanticism After he had learnt the language — he could not have learnt much — he stated his conviction even more emphatically In his famous</p>
<p>[[126]]</p>
<p>JJber die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier (On the Language and Wisdom of the Hindus), which he published in 1808, he issued what might be called the manifesto of a new Renaissance for Europe from India</p>
<p>If the study of the Indian language [he wrote] were able to find only a few men to pursue it* Thus in Italy and in Germany in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was seen a sudden outburst of an ardent love for Greek and Latin literature within a very short period of time, so that through a rediscovered knowledge of antiquity the whole aspect of science or to be more exact that of the world came to be changed and as it were renovated Not less sweeping, not less general, we venture to say, will be the result of Indian studies, if they are undertaken with equal ardour and if they are introduced into the classical circle of learning in Europe And why should it not be so ?</p>
<p>Though this fervent expectation from India had come into existence without any worthwhile acquaintance with Indian literature and history among the German pre-Romantics and Romantics, it was actually sustained and developed by the objective and painstaking work in India of a number of English Orientalists who, in whatever leisure they could secure from their administrative work, tried to collect as much reliable information about the history and civilization of their Hindu subjects as they could, men like Sir William Jones, Wilkins, Colebrooke, Halhed, to mention only the more important figures They were aided and encouraged in this work by the policy of Warren Hastings, who believed in and patronized Oriental learning both from intellectual curiosity and a realization of its importance for the rightful governing of India which, according to his own conviction, could be done only in the Indian way These scholars founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal m 1784, began to publish their work in its journal, Asiatic Researches , and within ten years a number of important Sanskrit works m translation made it possible for men of letters in Europe to form some adequate idea of what Sanskrit literature was like. The key works and dates of this early phase were as follows Bhagavad-Gita by Wilkins in 1785; his Httopadesa in 1787, Sakuntala by Sir William Jones in 1789; Gita-Govinda by Jones in 1792.</p>
<p>None of these men, with the exception of Sir William Jones, had enthusiasm in the slightly pejorative connotation of the age, and even Jones did not allow his enthusiasm for ancient India to sup-</p>

<p>press his scientific spirit On the other hand Colebrooke, who made the most substantial contributions to the extant body of information about the Hindu past, was the coolest and the most rigorous of them all As a young official in India he at first even resisted the enthusiasm of the local Orientalists, considering it facile and superficial But his accuracy and industry made him the foremost scholar among them when he applied himself to Indian subjects</p>
<p>But their work had a sensational effect in Germany, where the Asiatic Researches were read, along with the other books, with an almost delirious interest Of all the early books it was Jones’s translation of Kalidasa’s Sakuntala which produced the most powerful impression He published it from Calcutta under the title of Sacontala or The Fatal Ring An Indian Drama , and it went into five impressions immediately and made Jones famous all over Europe. Herder wrote to one of his friends</p>
<p>Do you not wish with me that instead of these endless religious books of the Vedas , Upavedas , and U pang as , they would give us the more useful and more agreeable works of the Indians, and especially their best poetry of every kind ? It is here that the mind and character of a nation is best brought to life before us, and I gladly admit that I have received a truer and more real notion of the manner of thinking among the ancient Indians from this one Sakuntala , than from all their Upangas and Bagavedams</p>
<p>Goethe’s apostrophe to Sakuntala is, of course, famous</p>
<p>Willte Du die Bluthe des fruhnen, die Fruchte des spateren Jahres, Willt Du, was reizt und entzuckt, willt Du was sattigt und nahrt, Willt Du den Himmel, die Erde mit emem Namen begreifen,</p>
<p>Nenn ich, Sacontala , Dich, und so ist Alles gesagt</p>
<p>(Wilt Thou the blossom of spring and the fruits that are later in season, Wilt Thou have charms and delights, wilt Thou have strength and support, Wilt Thou with one short word encompass the earth and heaven, All is said if I name only, Sacontala , Thee.)</p>
<p>Goethe wrote this when he was getting tired of the intellectual Charlotte von Stem and finding a different kind of happiness in the arms of his bettschatz (treasure of the bed), Christiane Vulprns, whom the proud Weimar ladies called his Tatter Half’ Perhaps he saw in the unsophisticated hermitage girl that Sakuntala was, an etherealized Christiane</p>
<p>5 *</p>
<p>[[128]]</p>
<p>Goethe&rsquo;s admiration of Sakuntala is however just symbolic, and it is referred to only because of his great name He was not in the mam stream of Orientalism in Germany, literary or speculative He was not interested either in Hindu religion or in Hindu philosophy, and felt a kinship solely with such Sanskrit poetry as he could read in translation Hindu art repelled him, the worshipper of the Apollo Belvedere, and he wrote ‘The tiresome trunks of elephants, the coiling nests of crawling snakes, the age-old tortoise m its cosmic swamp, those kingly heads on a single trunk — such things will turn us mad 5 And he cried T should like to live in India, if only there had been no stone-masons there 9</p>
<p>The typical impact of ancient Hindu India on the German mmd was seen in the true Romantics who came later — the two Schlegels, Novahs, Tieck, Jean-Paul Richter, Ruckert and the like, and among philosophers in Schopenhauer above all, but in Hegel and Schellmg too The first contacts with the authentic literature from India produced the most uncritically enthusiastic notions about the significance of Hindu civilization Sanskrit was represented as the mother of all languages The beginnings of all language, of all thought and of all religion were traced back to India F Schlegel even thought that the architectural monuments of Hindu India were as old as the Egyptian *</p>
<p>Bearing this attitude in mmd, in 1840 H H Wilson, the leading English Sanskritist of his time, who distrusted the German school of Sanskrit, wrote in the preface to his translation of the Vishnu Purana</p>
<p>It is the boast of inductive philosophy that it draws its conclusions from the careful observation and accumulation of facts, and it is equally the busmess of all philosophical research to determine facts before it ventures upon speculation This procedure has not been observed in the investigation of the mythology and traditions of the Hindus Impatience to generalize has availed itself greedily of whatever promised to afford materials for generalization, and the most erroneous views have been confidently advocated, because the guides to which their authors trusted were ignorant or insufficient</p>
<p>In the first thirty years of the mneteenth century, following some twenty of the eighteenth, as A W Schlegel said, Europe had acquired more knowledge about India, both ancient and modern, than she had obtained in the twenty-one centuries since Alexander</p>
<p>THE RIGVEDA</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>the Great This knowledge was assimilated in Germany in two ways First India, or whatever the Germans of that age looked upon as India, was absorbed as an element in the German selfhood, poetical as well as philosophical, which was expanding under the many-sided influence of the Romantic Movement, and in that absorption there was no India per se but only India as a colouring material of the stuff of German thought and feeling In the second approach India was treated as the primary object of investigation This activity manifested itself in the growth of a definite German school of Sanskrit and of Indology in a number of universities, and this school built up through erudition a German image or idea in the Platonic sense of India But though not unscientific, that image too was very characteristically German— a projection of the German Weltanschauung on India It was based wholly on an exegesis of books, and was an intellectual and imaginative but also a very selective reconstruction of the Hindu civilization and mind The length to which German speculation could go in pursuing its quest of India is very forcefully illustrated in Hegel, who wrote in his Philosophy of History</p>
<p>India has always been the land of imaginative inspiration, and appears to us still as a fairy region, an enchanted world In contrast with the Chmese state which presents only the most prosaic understanding, India is the region of phantasy and sensibility It is in the interest of spirit that external conditions should become mternal ones, and that the natural and the spiritual world should be recognized in the subjective aspect as belongmg to intelligence, by which process the unity of subjectivity and being generally — or the idealism of existence — is established This idealism is found in India, but only as an idealism of imagination In India the state of absolute being is presented as in the ecstatic state of a dreaming condition, and therefore in India was to be found, not the dreaming of an actual individual, but the dreaming of the absolute spirit*</p>
<p>The German historical reconstruction of India was not quite this castle in the very rarefied air of German philosophy Its feet at least, if not the head as well, was in touch with the Indian soil Even so, it was also a German structure built on concrete piles driven into the very treacherous morass of dependable knowledge about ancient India. It created the myth of Indian spirituality, which still haunts the world as part of two modern phenomena, the Hindu</p>
<p>[[130]]</p>
<p>chauvinism of our day, and the spiritual degeneracy of the contemporary West</p>
<p>Gradually however the absorption of India into the German personality stopped, and the foundation of the German Empire in 1870 is the key event in this eclipse On the other hand, the intellectual and scholarly interest too lost its pioneering spirit and its initial fervour The urge to discover a new world of thought and feeling m India weakened, and Indology became an established academic discipline concerned with filling out the gaps and correcting the details of the structure already created As early as 1859, when Max Muller published his first book on ancient Sanskrit literature, he had become conscious of this drift towards ossification He remarked that the progress of Sanskrit philology was being retarded by an affectation of learned pedantry, which had done so much mischief to Greek and Latin scholarship and which he had resented in his university days. He admitted that the specialist in Sanskrit had much to learn from the methods of a Bentley or a Hermann, but he also observed*</p>
<p>But in Greek and Latin scholarship the distinction between useful and useless knowledge has almost disappeared, and the real objects of the study of these ancient languages have been wellnigh forgotten More than half of the publications of classical scholars have tended only to impede our access to the masterworks of the ancients , and a sanction has been given to a kind of learning, which, however creditable to the individual, is of no benefit to the public at large A similar spirit has infected Sanskrit philology Sanskrit texts have been edited, on which no rational man ought to waste his time Essays have been written on subjects on which it is folly to be wise</p>
<p>In England, too, the great exploratory and garnering adventure of the early English Orientalists finally became a specialized academic discipline But before they converged on that ground, the British and German learning of Sanskrit and ancient Hindu India ran along different, though parallel, courses The very first difference was that even to the end of the nineteenth century the British learning never wholly lost its utilitarian object of being an aid and instrument in governing India But this help was sought by the British political authorities in the form of information, and never as an ideology to shape policies or even outlooks. This attitude influenced even those who officially represented Christianity and</p>
<p>THE RIG-VEDA</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>Christian morals in India, namely, the ecclesiastical establishment of the Government of India With a few distinguished exceptions the regular clergy in India left the cultivation of Sanskrit and the languages derived from it to the missionaries This, H H Wilson wrote in 1830, had had the harmful consequence of depriving the Christian presence in India of the means of exercising its proper religious and moral influence on Indians As he put it.</p>
<p>They have been unable to communicate freely with the Hindus, and have consequently failed to exercise that influence over them which it is likely they might enjoy to a much greater extent than the Missionaries In Bengal the better order of Hindus regard the Missionaries with feelings of inveterate animosity, whilst they invariably express a high respect for the clergymen of the Established Church They cannot avoid seeing that the latter are held in higher estimation by the European society, and that they cannot be reproached with practices which not infrequently degrade the Missionary character in the eyes of the Natives Did the regular clergy add to their personal respectability a reputation for scholarship in Indian literature, particularly the literature which the Hindus themselves consider as classical and sacred, consequences of the most important and beneficial nature might be confidently predicted</p>
<p>This of course did not happen, and could hardly be expected to happen, on account of the very narrow and severely practical view of the place of Sanskrit learning held by the British authorities The second important difference between the British and German schools of Sanskrit learning was that the British throughout remained in touch with the indigenous tradition of Sanskrit learning continued by the pandits in their time, which the Germans deprecated when they did not wholly reject it as obsolete or dead If this prevented the British Orientalists from building castles in the air, it also made them infuse some of the decadence, artificiality and fossilization present in the survival of Hindu culture among the pandits into their conception of Hindu civilization. They could not reconstruct an ancient India which was independent of the India of their age In other words, their account of ancient India never became so genuinely historical as was the reconstruction in the nineteenth century of classical antiquity by European historians of Greece and Rome</p>
<p>The third difference between Germany and Britain in respect of</p>
<p>[[132]]</p>
<p>Hindu civilization was that the English people did not accept it as an element in their mental formation and their cultural activity This result could never be expected from them when they were not ready to accept the Hindu heritage even for governing India There were a number of basic reasons for this rejection, the most important being their first-hand knowledge of living Hindus and of their ways The British in India found them to be so crude and ignorant and even degenerate that they could hardly believe that they had been highly civilized at any time Secondly, the positive and active ideology for the government of India, which developed after Warren Hastings and which admitted any possibility of progress on the part of the Indian people, was based on three schools of English political thinking Utilitarianism, Evangelism and Whig Liberalism All these were hostile to the beliefs and customs of the Hindus which they regarded as stagnant and obscurantist Lastly, the idea of ancient India which the British Orientalists were putting forward appeared to all progressive Englishmen as archaistic and retrogressive So all those who represented the progressive or liberal side of British rule in India discounted the value, and partly even the existence, of the Hindu civilization No one was more forthright in holding and expressing such a view than James Mill, the Utilitarian, who held an influential position in India House in London In his History of British India , which was published in 1817 and immediately became a classic, he attacked the idea that the Hindus were in any sense highly civilized at any period The whole of his second book is a coldly contemptuous dismissal and denunciation of the Hindus as creators and products of a high culture In later editions of the book H H Wilson tried to correct Mill’s bias in running footnotes disputing all his generalizations Even so Max Muller thought that the book was responsible for some of the greatest misfortunes that had happened to India Every aspect of Hindu life and culture was taken up by Mill and described from a standpoint opposite to that of the Orientalists, and the garment made by them was turned inside out. It was in demolishing their idea of Sanskrit literature that Mill was most ruthless Among peoples who were just entering a civilized state, Mill said, all literary expression was in verse The literature of the Hindus had always remained in this first state Mill more specifically made both the book which established the idea of a great literature in Sanskrit, and the man who was respon-</p>

<p>133</p>
<p>sible for presenting it to Europe, the objects of his criticism Of Sacontala he said that though it had some pretty passages, as a whole it was not a &lsquo;story which was above the powers of imagination m an uncultivated age’ and there was nothing in it ‘which either accorded with the understanding or could gratify the fancy of an instructed people 5 Of Sir William Jones he spoke with regret and even some disapproval ‘It was unfortunate that a mind so pure, so warm in the pursuit of truth, and so devoted to oriental learmng, as that of Sir William Jones, should have adopted the hypothesis of a high state of civilization in the principal countries of Asia 5</p>
<p>Nevertheless Mill succeeded in spreading a view which became influential and determined policy In Macaulay his disparagement of Sanskrit literature became a cool appraisal, and the basis for the support given to English as the medium of education in India In his famous minute on education in India written on February 2, 1835, he wrote about Sanskrit literature</p>
<p>I have no knowledge of either Sanscrit or Arabic But I have done what I could to form a correct estimate of their value I have read translations of the most celebrated Arabic and Sanscrit works I have conversed both here and at home with men distinguished by their proficiency in the Eastern tongues I am quite ready to take the Oriental learning at the valuation of the Orientalists themselves I have never found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia The intrinsic superiority of Western literature is, indeed, fully admitted by those members of the Committee who support the Oriental plan of education It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgements used at preparatory schools in England In every branch of physical or moral philosophy the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same</p>
<p>The disparaging thesis, promulgated by two men who were regarded as the greatest authorities on India of their age, persisted and was not wholly discredited even in the twentieth century In 1917 William Archer, the dramatic critic, published a book entitled India and the Future , in which he denied that India was civilized in the accepted European sense. I myself remember the scandal it raised, and its refutation came, among others from Aravmda Ghosh, more famous under the name of Shri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>[[134]]</p>
<p>Of course, in spite of the detractors, the English Orientalists carried on their researches as scholars and their propaganda as apologists But their discoveries and views as well as their defence built up only a counter-thesis for those who were seriously interested m ancient India As for the educated British public, at their most understanding and sympathetic they recognized ancient Indian culture as a civilization in being at one time, but which was also for them a thing apart The majority were indifferent, except when they looked at things Indian as curiosities Outside a circle of more or less charlatanesque dabblers and pedlars of Indian spirituality, there was no disposition to assign any universal human value to the religion, philosophy, literature and art of the Hindus</p>
<p>Max Muller avoided both extremes, the callow German enthusiasm and the hardboiled English contempt He adopted and retained in his attitude to India the strongest and the most sympathetic features of the interest in that country of both Englishmen and Germans He never shed the enthusiasm he had imbibed from the Romantic Movement, nor the pioneering spirit of the early days of Sanskritic studies Driven by the ideological motivation of the German Indophiles, he continued to seek the origins of religion and thought through a study of ancient Indian literature He also believed that it had a value for all men and for all time But he derived from the English Orientalists his conviction of the practical importance of Sanskrit for British administrators as well as for contemporary Hindus He thought and said that British rule would be more understanding and sympathetic, and therefore more productive of good for the Indian people if the ruling order became familiar with their culture On the other hand, he expected a regeneration of the life of the Hindus by bringing their own cultural heritage to their knowledge Lastly, he showed the most humane side of the English scholarly interest in India by becoming not only an apologist but a very vigorous champion of Hindu culture, and telling Englishmen how much they had to learn from India By combining all these positions in his function of Indologist, he maintained the primacy of England in Sanskritic studies in the Western world /</p>
<p>He proclaimed the larger purpose of Sanskrit philology quite emphatically in the introduction to the first book he wrote on Sanskrit literature A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature , published in 1859 He wrote.</p>
<p>THE RIGVEDA</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>The object and aim of philology, in its highest sense, is but one, to learn what man is, by learning what man has been With this principle for our pole-star, we shall never lose ourselves, though engaged in the most minute and abstruse inquiries Our own studies may seemingly refer to matters that are but secondary and preparatory, to the clearance, so to say, of the rubbish which passing ages have left on the monuments of the human mind But we shall never mistake that rubbish for the monuments which it covers If, then, it is the aim of Sanskrit philology to supply one of the earliest and most important links in the history of mankind, we must go to work historically, that is we must begin, as far as we can, with the beginning, and then trace gradually the growth of the Indian mind, in its various manifestations, as far as the remaining monuments allow us to follow this course</p>
<p>The primary object of Muller’s Sanskrit studies was thus neither philology nor literature as such, but the evolution of religious and philosophical thought Indeed, to his history of ancient Sanskrit literature he added the qualification ‘so far as it illustrates the primitive religion of the Brahmans’ Therefore he was bound to specialize in Vedic literature Mentioning the fact that all later Sanskrit books on religion, law and philosophy refer back to one early and unique authority called by the comprehensive name of the Veda, he wrote</p>
<p>It is with the Veda, therefore, that Indian philosophy ought to begin if it is to follow a natural and historical course So great an influence has the Vedic age (the historical period to which we are justified in referring the formation of the sacred texts) exercised upon all succeeding periods of Indian history, so closely in every branch of literature connected with Vedic traditions, so deeply have the religious and moral ideas of that primitive era taken root in the mind of the Indian nation, so minutely has almost every private and public act of Indian life been regulated by old traditionary precepts, that it is impossible to find the right point of view for judging of Indian religion, morals, and literature without a knowledge of the literary remains of the Vedic age</p>
<p>But in actual fact, Muller’s study of Sanskrit literature did not begin at its starting point, and in the circumstances it could not The early European Orientalists could not begin the study of Sanskrit and Sanskrit literature with the earliest books in the language. As Max Muller pointed out, the Hellenists began where they ought</p>
<p>[[136]]</p>
<p>to begin, namely, with Homer, Herodotus and Thucydides, and not with Anacreontic poetry or Neo-Platomst philosophy But the Orientalists concerned with ancient India had to begin with later books, like the code of Manu , the Gita , the Hitopadesa , Sakuntala and such works in classical Sanskrit At that stage of Sanskntic studies no authentic text of the Vedas was available, nor was Yedic Sanskrit known</p>
<p>So Max Muller also began with classical Sanskrit literature, and he also shared the current admiration for it His first work in Sanskrit scholarship was a translation of the Hitopadesa But from the beginning his mam interest was in ideas, and therefore he had been drawn towards the ZJpanishads&gt; though he had also read a little of the Rig -Veda</p>
<p>In later life, in a letter to Gladstone (January 18, 1883), Max Muller described this backward progression of Sanskntic research from classical Sanskrit literature to early Vedic literature, and also explained its significance In presenting Gladstone with a copy of his lectures on India delivered at Cambridge in 1882 he tried to interest the great statesman, and he wrote</p>
<p>I must confess I have long wished for an opportunity of engaging your interest in behalf of India , I do not mean the mere surface India, with its grotesque religion, its pretty poetry, and its fabulous antiquity, but the real India that is only slowly emerging before our eyes, a whole, almost forgotten act in the great drama of humanity, very different from Greece, from Rome, from modern Europe, and yet not so different that in studying it we cannot feel that mutato nomine de nobis fabula narratur The discovery of that real India, of that new intellectual hemisphere, is to my mind a far greater discovery than that of Vasco da Gama’s</p>
<p>Then he described the manner in which this India of his was recovered and studied</p>
<p>It was a misfortune [he observed] that all early publications of Sanskrit texts belonged really to the Renaissance of Sanskrit literature Kalidasa’s plays, which were supposed to be contemporaneous with Virgil, belong to the sixth century, the Laws of Manu, which Sir William Jones placed 1280 b c , cannot be older than 300 a d But there was an older literature in India, the Vedic and the Buddhistic, which are only now being slowly disinterred, and it is here that we can watch a real growth from the simplest beginnings to the highest concepts which the</p>
<p>[[137]]</p>
<p>human mind is capable of, it is there that we can learn what man is,</p>
<p>by seeing once more what man has been</p>
<p>As an old admirer of Gladstone, Max Muller hoped that he would look at the work the Sanskrit scholars had been doing recently, but he was also realistic enough to see that the fulfilment of his desire was not to be expected However, the letter very clearly explained the beginning of Vedic studies</p>
<p>As has been mentioned in a previous chapter, it was after going to Pans and meeting Burnouf that, following the old scholar’s advice, Muller decided to make the Rig-Veda the mam subject of his researches When he saw Burnouf the latter told him ‘We know what is in the Upanishads , but we want the hymns and their native comments.’</p>
<p>Burnouf made his advice even more explicit ‘Either one thing or the other Either study Indian philosophy and begin with the Upanishads and Sankara’s commentary, or study Indian religion and keep to the Rig-Veda , and copy the hymns and Sayana’s commentary, and then you will be our great benefactor ’ He insisted more particularly on publishing the commentary on the Rig-Veda by Sayanacharya, which dates from the fourteenth century ‘Don’t publish the extracts from the commentary only,’ he added ‘If you do, you will publish what is easy to read, and leave out what is difficult ’ Max Muller thought that it would be very difficult to find a publisher for so large a work, but when he confided his fear, said ‘The Commentary must be published, depend on it, and it will be ’ So Max Muller was launched on the project which kept him engaged for thirty years</p>
<p>At this time the study of the Vedic literature was in a very rudimentary state The legend of the Veda as the ‘AryanBible’ had been created long before the true text of the Rig-Veda was known The earliest authentic account of Vedic literature was given by Colebrooke in his paper ‘On the Vedas or Sacred Writings of the Hindus’, published in the Asiatic Researches , vol VIII, printed in Calcutta in 1805, and for decades this essay remained the basis of all serious and scholarly discussion on the subject The only printed text available was that of the first book of the Rig-Veda , edited with a Latm translation and incomplete notes (also in Latin) by Rosen, and published in 1838 in London by the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland. It was by basing himself on this text</p>
<p>[[138]]</p>
<p>supplemented by the manuscripts in the Bibliotheque Royale that Burnouf lectured on the Rig-Veda But he never published any extensive work on it His incidental comments are embodied in his commentary on the Yagna</p>
<p>Burnouf not only told Muller what Vedic mss were to be found m the Bibliotheque Royale, but lent him his own mss Muller then began to copy and collate all the manuscripts he could use, but he found to his astonishment that he was making many mistakes Therefore, in order to avoid the extra labour of comparing his own copies with the originals, he devised a method of using transparent paper and tracing every letter At first his progress was slow, but with practice he increased his speed, and his materials grew in extent and value</p>
<p>Max Muller trod a lonely path, and worked independently of the other Sanskntists in the field, though he was engaged on a task which was most important and urgent in connexion with the RigVeda, namely, the publication of a full text with the commentary of Sayana Rudolph Roth, who with Muller, became the most notable scholar on the Rig-Veda , was several years his senior But they never got on well together, though they were fellow-pupils of Burnouf</p>
<p>It has already been related how Muller came to England to carry on his work and secured the patronage of the East India Company, and how at last he settled at Oxford because the printing was being done by the University Press The work had begun in the early part of 1847 as soon as th e question of financing it had been decided At first progress was slow because many of the types had to be manufactured, and printing Sanskrit needed 300 types What surprised Muller when he was superintending the printing from London was that on the proofs many of his own mistakes on the copy were either corrected or queried At last he asked if there was a Sanskrit scholar at Oxford who was doing this He was told that there was none, but that it was the compositor himself, who did not know a word of Sanskrit, who was responsible for both When at Oxford he asked the man how he came to make the corrections ‘Well, sir, my arm gets mto a regular swing from one compartment of types to another, and there are certain movements which never occur. So, if I suddenly have to take up types which entail a new movement I feel it, and I put a query 9 Of course, this was due to the fact that in all languages certain combinations (like s following an h in English) can never occur, and these impossibilities are numerous in Sanskrit</p>
<p>THE RIG-VEDA</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>But by July 1847 the first two sheets of the text of the Rig-Veda were printed off, and on July 13, he sent them to Burnouf in Pans, followed by the first sheet of the commentary by Sayana on October 8 His object in doing so was to obtain Burnouf’s opinion on the soundness of the general principle of printing and style that he had adopted The old scholar sent his enthusiastic approval in a letter written on November 9, 1847, writing T thank you for having sent me the sheets of your grand edition of the Rig-Veda I use the word grand, not to avoid saying excellent, for I consider it both grand and excellent, but because I must express my admiration of Professor Wilson’s fine and vigorous Devanagari type ’</p>
<p>As to the quality of the editing, Burnouf said T must own that I am astonished that in so short a time you have been able to master the mass of materials in hand 5 Then the old scholar and pioneer in France of Vedic studies, concluded with a generosity which is not common among specialists He wrote</p>
<p>I congratulate you with all my heart on your debut, and I venture to say on your success, for your success is secured It is a great delight to do it for a man whose knowledge I admire and whose character I love And I think I may be allowed to reflect with pleasure on any effort I may have made to encourage you to march on in entire independence, avoiding all collaborations This is the only thing on which I can pride myself, and again it is entirely to your honour, because it only proves that I recognized all that science might expect from you</p>
<p>Anything nobler from an old scholar to a scholar of twenty-six can hardly be imagined.</p>
<p>Max Muller steadily produced the sheets, and in two years finished the editing and printing of the first volume, which was published at the end of 1849 The Oxford University Press must be given the credit for producing a volume which in its beauty of typography and layout recalled to me some of the early incunabula from the presses of Aldus and Jenson The volume, a heavy quarto, was presented to the British Museum by the Court of Directors of the East India Company It is in mint condition, and on its flyleaf is pasted a letter in the beautiful handwriting of the day, forwarding it and explaining the scope of the work</p>

<p>The Court of Directors of the East India Company impressed with a sense of the great Literary and Antiquarian Value of the ‘Rig-Veda Sanhtta 3 or Sacred Hymns of the Brahmans as containing important facts relating to the early Religion, History, and Language of the Hindoos, and actuated by a desire to perpetuate and render the Work accessible to the World of Letters, have authorized the publication at the Company’s expense of an Edition of the Manuscript, together with its Sanskrit Commentary by Sayanacharya , and the First Volume of the Work, which it is expected will be comprized in four volumes has now issued from the Press, Edited by Dr Max Muller of Berlin, under the general superintendence of Professor H H Wilson, the Company’s Librarian</p>
<p>The Work is intended for sale to those who may desire to possess it, but it is the intention of the Court to make gratuitous distribution of Copies to certain Public Institutions, and to a few distinguished individuals, and the Court have commanded me to state that they have much pleasure in presenting a Copy of the first Volume, which is herewith forwarded for deposit in the Library of the British Museum</p>
<p>The remaining volumes will be forwarded in like manner as they successively appear</p>
<p>They were, and the six volumes of the first edition in the Department of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts of the British Museum are this presentation set bound in morocco</p>
<p>One particular feature of bibliographical interest in this volume might be mentioned It had a second title-page in Sanskrit, in which Max Muller Sanskritized the names of Germany, Oxford and himself respectively as Sharmanya Desha (the Brahmimc country), Ukshatarana (ford of the Ox), and Bhatta Moksha Mulara (the learned Moksha Mulara, the nearest Sanskrit-sounding equivalent to his name, but later translated by the pandits of India as the ‘giver of the root of salvation’ by means of an etymological flight worthy of Sayanacharya himself) Since, in boyhood, I often saw him mentioned as Moksha Mulara in Bengali magazines and books, I assumed that we in India had transformed his name mto an Indian form But from the first volume of his edition I discovered that it was Muller himself who was responsible for this After the publication of the first volume Muller proceeded with the preparation of the second volume, but his appointment as Deputy Taylorian Professor of Modern Languages prevented his giving full attention to the Rig-Veda Still he carried on for more</p>
<p>THE RIG-VEDA</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>than two years, and finished the preparation of the greater part of volume two But towards the end of 1852 he fell ill, and found it advisable to follow the advice Bunsen had long been giving him, to engage an assistant for the Rig-Veda Bunsen also seems to have suggested the name of a Sanskrit scholar in Berlin, Dr Aufrecht Muller entered mto negotiations with him, and Aufrecht arrived at Oxford in the middle of December 1852 As this step was to produce a very unpleasant sequel for Max Muller, and after his death for his wife, it is necessary to describe his relations with his assistant m some detail Early in December Muller wrote to Bunsen £ I expect Aufrecht daily You have always advised me to seek help, and I could no longer get through my work alone, with the many interruptions caused by my health Aufrecht is a very conscientious scholar, and as far as the rest goes that will be all right ’</p>
<p>After that Muller reported to his mother on December 19 ‘Dr Aufrecht is a very clever man, a Sanskritist, etc. We work together, and he helps me with my Veda , for which I pay him enough to live here We shall try the plan at first for six months, and I hope it will go well. 5</p>
<p>Aufrecht as a scholar seems to have been of the type which made Mock Turtle describe his classical master as an old crab Besides, he had not been baptized, and that caused him mental unsettlement So after a few weeks’ association with him Muller again wrote to his mother, on February 2, 1853</p>
<p>I get on better with Aufrecht, but not so very well yet He decidedly desires to be baptized, but he does not feel inclined to talk to others on this point or anything connected with it It is possible that when he has once taken this step he may get to feel more inner satisfaction and confidence in friends But there can be no question about working together , for as soon as one presses him a little hard he draws his head mto a shell like a tortoise But I still hope that in time things will take a better shape</p>
<p>Seventeen days later Muller writes to his mother again, and says ‘I am very well and happy Aufrecht begins to “thaw”.’ During the Easter holidays of 1853 Aufrecht, according to his own wishes, was baptized by Bunsen’s son, Henry, who was an Anglican clergyman and Rector of Lilleshall</p>
<p>The second volume of the Rig-Veda was published early in 1854, and in its preface, dated Christmas, 1853, Max Muller formally</p>
<p>[[142]]</p>
<p>acknowledged Aufrecht’s help for the first time in these words Tn the latter portion of this volume I have been able to avail myself of the assistance and active co-operation of my learned friend Dr Aufrecht of Berlin, and the benefit hence derived cannot be too highly valued 5</p>
<p>On March 10 he wrote to his mother ‘Aufrecht is still working for me, but he lives in another house for himself, and gives private lessons He is happy here, and very useful to me, but it is rather expensive ’</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1855 Aufrecht decided to leave Max Muller and Oxford, and to go to London, So Muller wrote to Bunsen ‘Aufrecht has at last made up his mind to go to London I have written to Dr Jelf, who may probably secure for him the Sanskrit Professorship at King’s College Aufrecht was too good for this mechanical work ’</p>
<p>In the preface to the third volume, published in 1856, Muller acknowledged Aufrecht’s assistance as follows T have had again for this volume the valuable assistance of my learned friend Dr Aufrecht, and I sincerely regret that I shall no longer enjoy this advantage ’</p>
<p>Finally, in the preface to the fourth volume published in 1862, Muller wrote</p>
<p>I have stated on former occasions how much I owed to the assistance of my learned friend Professor Aufrecht, and I am glad to say that in the present volume also I have to a considerable extent had the benefit of his co-operation Though I regret his departure from Oxford, nothing could have been more beneficial to the interests of sound Sanskrit scholarship in this country than his appointment to the Chair of Sanskrit at Edinburgh</p>
<p>After the departure of Aufrecht Muller secured the help of other young Sanskrit scholars, and carried through the work to its completion by publishing the fifth volume in 1872 and the sixth in 1874 On July 1 Max Muller wrote the last lines of his text of the Rtg~ Veda , and only the preface remained to be written The first International Congress of Orientalists was held in London from September 14 to 21, 1874 To it came all the distinguished Oriental scholars of the day, including Max Muller’s first teacher of Sanskrit, Brockhaus Muller presided over the Aryan section and delivered a very eloquent address on the importance of</p>
<p>THE RIG-VEDA</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>Oriental studies and learning At the end of the address he presented the last sheet of the last volume of the Rtg-Veda to the Congress The volume was published at the end of the year, and in its preface he took leave of the work in the style of Gibbon ‘When I had written the last line of the Rtg-Veda and Sayana’s commentary, and put down my pen, I felt as if I had parted with an old, old friend ’</p>
<p>In the preface Muller also clearly explained how he had worked with his assistants and acknowledged their help</p>
<p>I believe I have acknowledged, without stmt, whatever assistance I have received from other scholars durmg the progress of my work They themselves have assured me, that I have said more than they deserved or expected I have never liked the rule, followed by nearly all scholars, of not acknowledging services for which payment has been accepted But as it has been broadly hinted, that for certain portions of Sayana’s commentary, I had parted with my editorial responsibility, I take this opportunity of stating, once for all, that there is no page, no line, no word, no letter, no accent, in the whole commentary, for which I am not personally responsible</p>
<p>At this point I must go back to Max Muller’s first detailed examination and description of the Rtg-Veda and the whole of Vedic literature, which was published in 1859 Already, when he was completing the first volume of his presentation of the text of the RtgVeda , Muller had written a long explanatory essay, both descriptive and historical, on Vedic literature, and he wished to print it as a preface to the volume With the approval of Bunsen he wrote a letter to the Court of Directors of the East India Company seeking permission to do so</p>
<p>The Directors agreed to his petition, which was a great sui prise to Muller This happened thiough Bunsen’s intervention Max Muller thought he would print and publish it in England, and a note was inserted in the first volume announcing that an introductory memoir on the literature of the Vedas was ready for publication Ten sheets of the essay were printed by 1851, when he was appointed Deputy Taylorian Piofessor and had to give up the project for want of time. However, he adapted parts of the intended prolegomena into an essay for the Prix Volney awarded by the Institute of France The competition was hard, but Burnouf and other friends worked foi him, and e,*rly in. October 1849 Burnouf</p>
<p>[[144]]</p>
<p>gave him the glad news that he had got the prize, which was 1,200 francs</p>
<p>For ten years Muller could do nothing further with the essay, but in 1859 he brought it out as his first full-length book, A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature , and dedicated it to Horace Hayman Wilson, as ‘a token of admiration and gratitude by his pupil and friend, Max Muller&rsquo; In the meanwhile, a good deal of work had been done by other scholars who had concerned themselves with the Vedas In the preface to his book Muller mentioned the names of Wilson, Burnouf, Lassen, Bemfey, Roth, Boehthngk, Kuhn, Regmer, Weber, Aufrecht, Whitney, among the most notable workers He himself had also published a short essay on the Vedas m 1853 He regretted that owing to external circumstances he had been anticipated by others in producing a general account of Vedic literature, but that regret was balanced by his satisfaction in finding that in the mam his original views had not been shaken either by his own further researches or by those of others Quite deliberately the preface of the book was dated August 3, 1859, ^he day of his wedding Like his marriage, the book was a great success It is surprising to note that this highly specialized book of 607 pages, containing in its index of 19 pages more than 1,500 Sanskrit words and names, and also Sanskrit citations in the text in Deva Nagan type, was completely sold out in its first edition in less than five months, and a second edition had to be brought out in i860 There were also long and appreciative reviews not only in the learned journals but also in the newspapers The Times published a flattering review on December 30, 1859 Two of the scholarly reviews were by Wilson himself in the Edinburgh Review for October, i860 (the last thing he wrote, but published after his death), and by the great French Orientalist Barthelemy St Hilaire, in five articles in the Journal des Savants , the famous journal of scholarship The French scholar said that Muller&rsquo;s book showed considerable progress in Vedic studies and answered a number of questions, and, above all, it brought order and light into the huge and confused treasure-house of the primitive monuments of Brahmanic religion According to him the book was of so high an order that it was not likely to be surpassed or even equalled for a long time Wilson wrote Tt is not possible in a brief survey like the present to render justice to a work every page of which teems with information that no other scholar ever has, or could have, placed before the public *</p>
<p>THE RIG-VEDA</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>A third edition of the book was also called for But Max Muller thought that Yedic studies were making such rapid progress that with the time he could give to the subject he could not keep abreast of it His failure to get the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit at Oxford at the end of i860 made it impossible for him to devote himself exclusively to Sanskrit literature To carry on the publication of the text of the Veda was in itself a task heavy enough So he never re-published this pioneering book</p>
<p>But he did not feel happy about it In a letter to his wife written on December 7, 1864, he said ‘I still have a great work to do, and I often feel that I might have done a great deal more, if I kept the one object of my life more steadily in view I sometimes wish you would help me more in doing that, and insist on my working harder at the Veda and nothing else I hope I shall finish that work * Then he explained to her how his edition and translation of the Veda was likely to help the Hindus in recovering the original spirit of their religion (see p 90) and observed ‘If those thoughts pass through one’s mind, one does grudge the hours and days and weeks that are spent in staying in people’s houses, and one feels that with the many blessings showered on one, one ought to be up and doing what may be God’s work ’</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his self-accusation, he continued to work on both the text and translation of the Rig-Veda Moreover, till almost the end of his life he never neglected any opportunity to explain the meaning and importance of the Vedas to a larger public He delivered a long lecture at Leeds in March, 1865, before its Philosophical Institution, devoted five of his seven lectures at Cambridge m 1 88a to the Vedas , and, last of all, summed up his views on them in the second volume of Auld Lang Syne , containing recollections of his Indian friends, among whom he counted the Rig-Veda That was in 1898, two years before his death</p>
<p>He even made use of social occasions to promote knowledge and respect for Vedic literature When the phonograph was invented one of its first appearances in England was at a party at the house of J. Fletcher Moulton, Q c , and afterwards in P There was a fashionable company, with some eminent men of letters and men of science Among them was also the American journalist, a friend of Max Muller’s, Moncme D Conway, who in his long notice on Muller after his death, published in the North American Review , described the incident. I shall quote his account</p>
<p>[[146]]</p>
<p>Max Muller was first called on to utter something in the phonograph We presently heard issuing from it these sounds Agmm tie purohitam Yajnasya dev am ntvtjam — hotaram ratnadhatamam There was a burst of merriment when these queer sounds came from the machine, but a deep silence when Max Muller explained that we had heard words from the oldest hymn in the world — the first (if I remember rightly*) in the Vedas ‘Agm I worship — the chief priest of the sacrifice — the divine priest — the invoker — conferring great wealth *</p>
<p>And then young people gathered round the smiling scholar to ask questions Moncure Conway did not hear exactly what Muller said to them because he</p>
<p>stood apart observing the picturesqueness of the scene, and finding in it something symbolical of the whole career of the polite scholar He had evoked from the oral Sanskrit phonograph the ancient Aryan literature and mythology, the thin, metallic voices became real and cast their poetic spell not merely on the learned, but on fashionable young ladies and gentlemen in drawing-rooms, throughout Europe and America, adding vast estates to then minds, delivering them from the mere^pmhole views of humanity and of the universe to which our ancestors were limited</p>
<p>I shall end this chapter by adding to Conway’s vivid account of the impact of his work on the Vedas , the observation on it of one of the leading Sanskrit and Vedic scholars of our times, in Louis Renou ‘Nul n’a contnhue davantage / he says in a monograph entitled Les Maitres de la Philologie Vedique 3 c a creer le miracle vedique, consacre par une revelation surnaturelle, entretenu par d’exceptionelles cir Constances y il a apporte au service de cette cause le tribut d y un art et d’une science egales ’</p>
<p>* It is the first verse of the Rig-Veda</p>
