      <description>Chapter I
THE RIG-VEDA
It took Max Muller five years of continuous labour, which was partly mechanical drudgery, to complete the editing and printing of only the first volume of his edition of the Rig-Veda To understand the spirit and motivation of this project as well as his interest in the wider field of Sanskrit literature as a whole, it is necessary to take note of a basic contrast , that which existed between the German and English attitudes towards India in his young days This is essential because in his own position there was an amalgamation of the two He began as a purely German Indophile and Indologist, and soon assumed the roles in their British form, without however losing his original affiliation and inspiration</description>

BEATA GEORGINA
There is a gap of two years in the story of Max Muller’s love for Georgina Grenfell, between the spring of 1854 when his proposal for marriage was rejected by her family, and the spring of 1856 when a love affair acknowledged and accepted by Georgina but without any hope of marriage began for them What happened in the intervening years is unrecorded both in the published biography and unpublished papers All that can be said is that Muller did not forget his love, and remained dejected But since he did not meet Georgina his suffering was not such that he could not put on a brave face to his mother, as he felt he must, because he knew that nothing would distress her more than the knowledge of his being unhappy in love So, to one of her letters written in 1855, in which there was the usual insistence on his marrying and even a suggestion as to a possible wife, he replied with humour ‘That you are so anxious to find me a wife is very good of you 1 Elise who delighted you so much in Carlsbad, seemed to me pleasant enough, but as I had no opportunity of knowing her better, I have never thought more about her If you are writing greet her kindly, but don’t make any proposal for her hand*’ The future Mrs Muller, on the othei hand, knew nothing of Max Muller’s love and was not herself consciously in love But the whole aspect of their relations changed dramatically in the early summer of 1856</description>

LANGUAGE
To Max Muller the Rig-Veda , which kept him occupied fully or partly for thirty years, was only a means to an end Not that he ever underrated the value of the means, absolute or relative, on the contrary, he emphasized its importance so much that people might justifiably have thought of him as a man who was riding a hobbyhorse Conscious of this, he again and again made out a case for studying the Rig-Veda Nevertheless, the establishment of its text and that of Sayana’s commentary, followed by an attempt to understand its meaning, was to him the preliminary investigation in a wider quest — the examination, in a particular field, of phenomena he was primarily interested in and wanted to understand In short, his work on the Rtg-Veda could be compared to the experiments carried out by a theoretical physicist or, better still, to the investigations of Darwin</description>

OXFORD-DARK AND BRIGHT
By the time Max Muller, as Taylorian Professor, had become an associate member, so to speak, of the academic club of Oxford — the date being February 1854 — the university had ceased to be the happy convent it was even in 1848 The Pax Oxomana was shattered at one stroke by the appointment of the Royal Commission of 1850 As Mark Pattison said, if a man had fallen asleep in 1846 and woken up again in 1850 he would have found himself in a different world It was tom into two factions, the opponents and the supporters of reform The old guard was in power, and feeling ran so high against the renegades that one of them asked a junior professor to invite him to dinner because the heads of colleges would no longer admit him to their table Actually, the Commission made a difference to the social habits of Oxford Before its appointment there were hardly any private dinners besides those in the halls But the Commission broke up the academic society into sets, and private dinners had to keep up the social life of those who were excluded from the high table on account of their support for reform</description>
