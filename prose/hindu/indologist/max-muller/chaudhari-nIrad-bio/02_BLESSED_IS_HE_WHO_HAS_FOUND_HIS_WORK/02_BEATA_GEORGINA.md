BEATA GEORGINA 

There is a gap of two years in the story of Max Muller’s love for Georgina Grenfell, between the spring of 1854 when his proposal for marriage was rejected by her family, and the spring of 1856 when a love affair acknowledged and accepted by Georgina but without any hope of marriage began for them What happened in the intervening years is unrecorded both in the published biography and unpublished papers All that can be said is that Muller did not forget his love, and remained dejected But since he did not meet Georgina his suffering was not such that he could not put on a brave face to his mother, as he felt he must, because he knew that nothing would distress her more than the knowledge of his being unhappy in love So, to one of her letters written in 1855, in which there was the usual insistence on his marrying and even a suggestion as to a possible wife, he replied with humour ‘That you are so anxious to find me a wife is very good of you 1 Elise who delighted you so much in Carlsbad, seemed to me pleasant enough, but as I had no opportunity of knowing her better, I have never thought more about her If you are writing greet her kindly, but don’t make any proposal for her hand\*’ The future Mrs Muller, on the othei hand, knew nothing of Max Muller’s love and was not herself consciously in love But the whole aspect of their relations changed dramatically in the early summer of 1856 

In her biography of her husband Mrs Max Muller was naturally very reserved about her marriage She briefly described his first visit to her father in November 1853, an -d set down what Muller had told her later about his final commitment to her from that very meeting As regards the second meeting from which a two-sided love affair started, she only wrote ‘In April of this year Max Muller had again met his future wife, and during six weeks they saw each other constantly at her home, and in London, and at the Grand Commemoration and Peace festivities in Oxford, little foreseeing the painful three years of total silence and separation that they had to go through before their marriage was allowed ’ But her own journal and Max Muller’s letters reveal a tragic experience

of suffering It is a story of romantic love without a ray of hope, until it ended suddenly and unexpectedly in happiness 

It has to be told at some length not only as an essential part of Max Muller’s life, or as a romance which no one would expect to be experienced by a scholar, but also for its historical interest as a part of the attitude to love in nineteenth-century England The idea of love which finds permanence in marriage without losing its intensity has become very distant in this age What has taken its place is the concept on which polygamy is based, with the difference that while the Hindu or the Muslim polygamist uses a number of women as notes in a simultaneously sounded chord, the modem Western polygamists play them arpeggio , making marriage very much a matter of sexual convenience, and their love life is an alternation of crests of infatuation with troughs of disillusionment, except for those who are too humdrum to enjoy that game of chance 

Vanitas vanitatum 3 omnia vanitas , and nobody saw the vanity more clearly than the great Christian Pascal, who said ‘A sense of the hollowness of present pleasures and failure to perceive the hollowness of absent pleasures cause inconstancy \* The Victorians, on the contrary, succeeded in a very great measure in reconciling the intensity of love with its concentration on one object This is most strikingly illustrated in a letter which Sir George Otto Trevelyan wrote to his daughter-in-law in 1908 at the age of seventy, when his wife was away from home for a few days T am never unhappy for a few days with work and solitude , for that amount of solitude, brief, and at long intervals, introduces an element of contemplation and recognition into one’s feelings about the person whose presence makes one’s life ’ Of course, many such examples can be given 

That does not mean, however, that at any level love between man and woman is free of the sexual urge Only a fool or a hypocrite will deny that this love originates in sexual desire and seeks its rhythmic fulfilment in physical union But only a fool will say that it is all sexual desire or lust, finding its ultimate satisfaction in a tactile sensation We Hindus committed that mistake and have paid the price So will the Western people if they go our way From the beginning of time men have been adding values and colours to this primordial urge until fully evolved love has become as differentiated from basic lust, as old port is different from absinthe, though both contain alcohol Indeed, the sublimation has gone further, and it

has made many ardent lovers feel that it is not of the order of the flesh, being a human replica of the love of and for God Max Muller held this view, or, to be more accurate, had this sort of feeling about love On the page of the journal of his future wife on which I read his confession of love at first sight, I also read ‘There can be no true and lasting love that has not its spring and life in God’ , also this ‘I felt we had this in common — our love to the same God, our faith m the same saviour, and our will to make our life on earth a sacrifice to him ’ His future wife, as I shall show presently, also held the same quasi-religious view of love 

In feeling in this way about love neither Max Muller nor Georgina were taking up any position which could be called individual We are hardly aware that what we call individual choice is normally nothing more than a particular adaptation to the general historical situation in which a person is placed In this case both the lovers stood at the convergence, in mid-nineteenth century England, of three historical trends, and therefore their love has to be placed in its historical setting These trends were — the Protestant rehabilitation of marriage, the romantic glorification of sexual love, and the Victorian transformation of the love of the Romantic Movement into married love Each of these has to be considered by itself 

The Protestant rehabilitation of marriage was a revolt against the Catholic Church’s prohibition of marriage for the clergy, and the corresponding attitude which regarded marriage only as a pis aller for those who remained in the world Sexual relations had the taint of original sm even in wedlock, and it was to rescue them from this taint that the Catholic Church made marriage a sacrament All these stemmed from the Pauline view that it was better to marry than to burn Luther fiercely rejected both celibacy of the clergy and the sacramental character of marriage But he asserted unambiguously that God himself had instituted marriage, and thus the Roman Church’s prohibition of marriage for the clergy was no better than Antichrist’s mounting himself to a place above God In his Be Captivitate Babylonica Ecclesiae he stressed the sacred and mysterious nature of marriage among believers and unbelievers alike This position was refurbished by a section of the Anglican clergy out of their revulsion from the unnatural emphasis placed on asceticism and virginity by the leaders of the Oxford Movement Mr Svaglic in his fine edition of Newman’s Apologia has pointed out that there was a passionate urge behind Kingsley’s attack on

him Kmgsley had found peace and had been able to reconcile the world and the spirit through his love for and marriage with Fanny Grenfell, and he revolted against the Catholic view which made such a pure bliss (derived as he thought from God) a sin Mr Svaglic also draws attention to the fact that Kingsley belonged to the circle of Carlyle, Froude, Tennyson, Shaftesbury and Bunsen, and shared their Germanic Protestant view of history, one of whose particular expressions was that the Reformation had reasserted the sanctity of marriage and the family, and revived the Teutonic virtues which had been suppressed by the Roman Church Max Muller belonged to the same circle 

There is direct evidence that Kmgsley held this view of sexual love and marriage In one of his letters to Max Muller he said he would fully decide in Muller’s favour if he were in Riversdale Grenfell’s place by saying to himself ‘The thing is of God, and I dare not fight against it ’ Furthermore, advising him to remain patient in his present disappointment, Kmgsley wrote Tt would be a great experiment, my comfort is, that it would be a great experiment in the highest sense of the word , a committing, as thousands have done, of true love into the hands of Him who inspired it, and saying, “God, Thou hast made this, surely Thou wilt also water and prune it till it bear fruit to everlasting life ”’ 

This will show to what school Muller’s love belonged But it belonged too at one remove to the romantic love of the early nineteenth century, especially in its German expression The Romantic revolt against the rationalism of the eighteenth century also impinged on the man-woman relationship The rationalistic attitude tended to ignore the differences between the sexes, to favour their equality in respect of position, interests, activities and opportunities, to emancipate women, and to create the femme forte Its impact on the physical relations between men and women attenuated passion and fostered sensuality To the pure rationalist the urge for sexual satisfaction is only a refined form of the urge to defecate, as was felt by Montaigne, the pioneer rationalist. You should not for your health’s sake resist it, but do not try to glorify it. 

The Romantic Movement rejected all this, lock, stock and barrel It proclaimed the particularity of man as well as woman, recognized the special genius and function of each, and thought that human life was made whole by a combination of the two As the Austrian Romantic, Lenau, put it 4 Who has genius ? Can woman have it ?

Fatuous question Man and woman have it conjointly 5 With this there was bound to go a glorification of the basic element in the manwoman relationship, sexual love This Romantic view of love treated marriage as an institution largely irrelevant to love In fact, it depicted love at its most intense outside wedlock There were two natural if not good reasons for doing so first, marriage was almost wholly subject to worldly considerations in that age, and the Romantic, who thought this degrading, wanted to make love independent of the world, second, sexual satisfaction in wedlock was also the assertion of a legal right, and that made the ardent Romantic have the same feeling for it as we have foi income-tax Moreover, they had no revulsion from the physical expression of love But that was wholly different from the nonchalance about sexual intercourse of men and women of our days, who have made the act as amoral and neuro-muscular as playing tennis To the Romantics, in contrast, the physical union was the climax of a passionate union 

The Germans took over the concept of Romantic love and practised it with traditional German thoroughness, and the Germans who did so most thoroughly were also the most solid Germans, the philosophers and scholars As I have discovered, it is very unsafe and unsound to try to appraise a German of the Romantic Age by his books These give a wholly wrong idea of his personality, passionate power and motives of action I have arrived at a more adequate image for the German scholar-philosopher he is the volcano which sends up hot, molten lava from his blazing depths, and that lava solidifies on the earth’s surface to become the hard basalt of his books 

Max Muller as lover was affiliated to that tradition Without assuming that, it is impossible to explain his equal devotion to the Rtg-Veda and to Georgina But living in England in the middle of the nineteenth century he could not be entirely a Romantic lover, not because Victonan England was cold and respectable but because that England had gone one step further in romanticism by bringing the illicit and burning love of the Romantic Age into married life It had carried out a revolution through which the wife became a greater idol than the mistress, and so no husband could say of her, like La Rochefoucauld II ne faut pas parley de sa femme To put it briefly, love retained all the strength and lure it had as sin, and yet became sanctified in wedlock The Victorians were stodgy 

m their moralizing but not in their love-making.

Since the words of love which Robert spoke to Elizabeth were heard and sanctioned by God, not all the Barretts of Wimpole Street could prevent her from becoming Mrs Browning Coventry Patmore defined love in marriage more directly 

The love of marriage, above All other kinds, the name of love, 

As perfectest, though not so high As love which Heaven with single eye Considers, Equal and entire,

Elsewhere ill-joined or found apart, 

Which now contracts, and now dilates, 

And both to the height exalting, mates Self-seeking to self-sacrifice 

These men and women, living in a profoundly religious age, had no streak of asceticism Far from it, they even obliterated the distinction which the early Christians, horrified by the Pagan lusts of the flesh, had drawn between Agape and Eros Max Muller moved naturally into this world of love What his love for Georgina was before his marriage I shall presently describe, but its character is even more intensely and truly revealed in a letter he wrote to her a year after his marriage. 

I went under the old Ilex tree and there I sat down and read it [her letter], and thought for a long time about my darling, and my happiness, and my unworthmess, and God's unbounded mercy 1 And then I heard the words within me, ‘Be not afraid Yes, my darling, there must be no fear When there is fear, then there is no perfect love Our happiness here is but a foretaste of our blessed life hereafter, we must never forget that We shall be called away, my darling, but we shall meet again My darling Georgina, you would sleep quietly and peacefully in the arms of your husband — but our Father in Heaven loves us more than any husband can love his wife, or any mother her child His hand will never hurt us So let us hope and trust always 

I cannot say that all this was typical of the academic life of Oxford Its monastic past, together with the obligation of celibacy for the fellows, made the dons either suspicious or incapable of love, and to this suspicion and incapacity a man, regarded as the incarnation of the Oxford spirit and who was also a friend of Max Muller, bears

witness He is no less a person than Benjamin Jowett His preoccupation was purity of life, and he set it down in his notebook that a man was not a man who did not control his passions He uses the word ‘passion’ in a bad sense But he was also aware how difficult it was for Oxford dons to master their passions, because their marriage was deferred generally for fifteen or twenty years after the passions were strongest, and was sometimes impossible without loss of rank The social downgrading through marriage was described by a Highland girl who saw Oxford just before Max Muller’s time, and she wrote that many heads of colleges, constant to the loves of their youth, brought ladies of inferior manners to grace what was so dignified a station in life 

But even Oxford dons could love The lecturer in mathematics at Christ Church, Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, fell in love with his Alice when she grew into a beautiful girl of sixteen, and had to be tacitly forbidden the house by Mrs Liddell, the famous Dean’s wife Mark Pattison, the most desiccated and calcinated of Oxford dons, married a very young girl probably out of love Even the great Benjamin Jowett had a romance with the even greater Florence Nightingale But all these men outgrew and survived their love, though not the spleen which is a by-product of unrequited love Lewis Carroll nursed a life-long spite against the Liddells, and even against their friends, one of whom was Max Muller, and Mark Pattison drove his wife into the arms of Sir Charles Dilke 

But the German Max Muller would certainly not have survived his love, if denied Actually, he once wrote to Miss Grenfell. T am a German, full of foolish romantic ideas, which give me happiness where no Englishman or woman would find it ’ But, as it happened, even in Victorian England his love did not end in tragedy, because he was not being slam by a cruel fair maid , on the contrary, Georgina herself was on the point of pining away It was an English father, insisting on a proper settlement for his daughter, who was putting impediment in the way of true love, and Max Muller could not employ the method by means of which in that age lovers of equal social and economic status could make the best of both worlds that is, by keeping the love-making to themselves and leaving the settlement to their solicitors 

The new act opened in April, 1856, with a letter from Max Muller to Miss Grenfell telling her about the accommodation he

had arranged for the Ray Lodge party at Oxford for the grand celebration there of the close of the Crimean War, at which Jenny Lind was to sing at two concerts 'The arrangements/ he wrote, 'will be somewhat Crimean, I fear, yet I have no doubt that the battle will be won There is one large bedroom and two small ones, so your maid will have to sleep in a neighbouring house If I had known yesterday I could have offered a bed to Mr Grenfell in my house I have secured carriage room and stalls for two horses, and beds for two servants, and by a most fortunate accident I got a ticket for the first concert ’ Then he gave details of the programme he had arranged and this included lunches and dinners and balls at many colleges, outings, and even visits to the Observatory where they were to see the Observer’s Heliometer and the stars generally The whole visit was most gay and festive 

It was at the end of the visit that Max Muller and Georgina Grenfell declared their love for each other, probably on June 5, one day before the Grenfells returned to Ray Lodge Muller’s inscription on his future wife’s journal ‘Zur Ennnerung an den 5 en Juni , 1856 , Oxford ’ bears testimony to the date But the episode is described with anguish by Georgina Grenfell in the very first entry of her journal kept from the middle of 1856 onwards She writes 

Ray Lodge, June 7 Returned from Oxford yesterday — I had such a sad ending to our gay week My poor little Muller I cannot bear to think of his grief In an agony he told me of his faithful love, and how for ever he should love me — and though I feel Papa is right, with his little income, in now saying No y yet I cannot but think of him What can it be in me that could win such intense love from him ? He in such real grief To hear such a man say that he felt that for two years his powers had been gomg, and to know that one word would make him happy, and that one might not, could not say that word, yes, it was trying mdeed My poor Muller But there are years before us and they all say some day he must hold a very high position and then perhaps Meantime, should not the love of such a man raise one ? I felt humbled by his fixing on me What am I compared to him ? Let me try in every way to raise my mind and be more fit to become the wife of one with such a mind 

This journal, kept over three years, is an extraordinary document It was as if the intensity of the love set down seemed to burn the very pages, and it would seem nobody but Max Muller and his wife

had read it before me Of its eighty pages, sixty-eight describe her suffering over the three years during which her father would not hear of her marriage with Max Muller, and this suffering is borne with such tenderness, stoicism and religious fervour that the pages read like a Magnificat in sorrow The rest of the pages, only twelve, record her joy and gratitude at being permitted to accept him, and they utter a Gloria in excelsis in happiness 

What strikes the reader in the first instance in this journal is the extraordinary frankness and honesty of the record On September 20, 1857, she asked herself 'Is it wise to write down all the thoughts that course thro’ the mind and answers herself ‘Yes, I think it does good if they are true ones 9 1 quote some passages to show that there can be no doubt about the frankness and truthfulness, and also to establish the key, and sound the leit-motives, of her love She writes on July 10, 1859, when she and Max Muller were meeting as affianced lovers ‘In the evening we stayed from Church and after sitting with Gommy [Miss Grenfell] sat together under the Ilex tree and then late at night we went to Charlotte’s arbour, and sat there heart to heart, till our souls seemed one, the mere bodily covering seemed too full of love and joy There are not many such hours in this workaday world, but they are pricelessly precious I \* \* \* 5 The next day brought a different kind of experience, and it is described in the next entry 'Max and I sat in the boat together It was very hot, and I was very cross, because he would kiss me I have since been very unhappy about it, for there was a grieved look in his eyes at my childish behaviour, which I could not bear to see again We sat and looked in each other’s eyes I often can hardly bear to meet his eyes I feel I am not worthy of all that God has given me, and then I shut my eyes or look into the far blue sky, and pray to be worthy of my own Max ’ 

She also makes no secret of her love affairs before she had finally fixed her love on him, and even of her waverings after she had She wrote on May 31, 1857 

I did not think I could so deeply and truly love anyone Before a year 

had passed from Captain HGW I was flirting most violently with 

Colonel Vyse I had all along thought in spite of myself that I had wasted a great deal of feeling on him, indeed I told Max so 

Charlotte tells me on good authority that he did really care for me, but that Papa would not hear of it, and hinted so to H G W , and this 

stopped all his attentions in that sudden way Somehow I am glad to

hear this, for tho’ I own it would have been a poor life with him and that I soon got over the feeling and that my love to Max is real and true, yet I did care for H G W very much and with all a girl’s eager feeling, and therefore I am glad to hear that he was not a mere flirt, attracted for a time by my lovely face 

She prays that she may not give in to coquetry, and at the very beginning of her passionate surrender to Max Muller sets down this prayer ‘Oh God, help me watch myself very carefully that womamty may [not ?] draw me from him ’ Even in 1857, when she was in deep despair and distress of mind, she wrote ‘If anyone were ever to see this book what would they think of me I had my whole time passed m affaires de cceur ? Why am I allowed to make so many unhappy ? Am I really careful enough or do I not like incense, and thus encourage these poor men? I will be far more circumspect Loving another as I do, I ought to be as indifferent as possible to everyone \* Furthermore, she does not suppress the natural envy that she feels and the sense of injustice that she has, when she sees others happy in their love, even her younger sister Charlotte ‘I have been staying with Mary Goodlake, seeing and enjoying her little home — I often wonder why such discipline is needed by Muller and me. I am so down tonight I could cry for hours Ah \* why cannot I find rest m God 5 After this entry comes another ‘There is Mabel Irby, who from the way she has gone on, cannot be capable of a deep true feeling, about to marry that clever Augustus Vansittart, and there are no difficulties of any kind Such is life — One glad and another miserable\* Oh\* Lord my God, keep my own dear Muller, in body, soul, and spirit as Thine ’ 

Last of all, she was capable of being extraordinarily realistic about money, the cause of her suffering On October 10, 1856, she wrote 

Gommy went to Eversley [Kingsley’s living] and saw Muller and, of course, they talked long of the subject His love for me is unchanged, and mine for him is as strong as ever Only I see now clearly all the difficulties He has .£500 from his Professorship and makes nearly £300 more by his writings, and my fortune could ensure the sum Papa demands This is small, but next year he will have £100 more I have thought it all over deeply, and I think I shall wait till next year, as I am now, and then see if in any way the thing is settled either way by external influences, if not I will try again to get Papa’s consent.

But the next year only brought new difficulties, and she wrote on April 1 8 ‘All this week I have been tried by feeling that perhaps I ought to give up Muller 1 Papa seems as determined as ever against it — and my friends even think would, if dead, leave some clause leaving away my fortune if I married Max, and I know no one could live on Max's income alone and make any provision for the future ’ As a matter of fact, she came to know later that he had altered his will, so that if his daughter had married Max Muller she would have had nothing 

But with all her honesty and realism she knew equally well that she could not give up Max, even if she would So, on the very day on which she set down her sensible view about money, she also wrote ‘I know many would say “Give him up", but it is like cutting away the ground under my feet I think I shall put it all before Uncle C K \* 

These samples should be enough to convince anybody of the honesty and frankness of an English girl of the Victorian Age, brought up in typical squirarchal surroundings, and also to give glimpses of her capacity for love I shall now set forth the story of her love in her own words, which will fully reveal her passionate intensity This should go to show that the idea that the Victorians were given to suppressing their passion is a myth There is no evidence for it in fact or fiction, rather, the evidence to the contrary is decisive The Victorians had no sense of guilt even about their libertinism, and seduced or committed adultery with as light a heart as anybody could do today, only perhaps with greater elegance and dignity The Victorian rake was as thoroughbred as his hunter, and the virtuous Victorians on their part had no sense of guilt about their virtue 

Georgina Grenfell was a modern Heloise in that her love was inseparable from her religion and morality There is not one sentence m her whole confession in which her love is not placed under the eyes and in the hands of her God The whole journal is written in tins spirit, and since it is not possible to reproduce the whole of it I shall give a selection of characteristic passages, 

June 8, 1856 The Sacrament today such a real help Long and deeply did I pray for dear Muller, that whatever was for our good might be done, and that in ‘silence and prayer\* we might bear all that God sends

June 28, 1856 Thank God after three weeks of sad anxiety and earnest prayer for him I have today heard that my dear Muller is more peaceful and enjoying the idea of his mother coming Ah\* were it not for deep earnest prayer, how could one bear it ? I cannot think of his grief Such a man Why, why am I allowed to cause sorrow to such a mind 7 God keep me true to him Every day I think more of him and feel if for our good God will order it all and allow it — But if it may never be, Gh f my God teach him to forget, lay not deep sorrow on him 

August 2, 1857 'Take from us all things hurtful and give us those things which be profitable for us ’ How very difficult to put up this prayer in faith and resignation — Yet God knows all and we can by no effort of ours make or mar His plans If He sees this right for us, then no power on earth can prevent it Shall we not wait on him then, and strive to possess our souls in patience ? 

After considering the financial situation of Muller, Georgina Grenfell had decided that for the present she would say goodbye to the subject and prayed to God to keep her true to Muller and herself But only a few days later she had to write 

October 19, 1857 'Thou knowest not what a day may bring forth’ — 'Man proposes, but God disposes’ — How easy to say and write this, but how hard to really believe and acquiesce in it I resolved when I closed this book ten days ago it should not be opened again for many months and yet in these ten days the story of my life has been decided 

On the 14th she got a letter from Max Muller begging her to settle the question in one way or another She at once wrote to her father entreating him to allow their marriage, and telling him how her whole heart was Muller’s, but he would not So, 'feeling that my first duty was to my father’, she wrote to Muller on the 17th to tell him that all was over and to say farewell Then she set down her feelings in her journal 

Thus the whole joy of my life is gone and his Ah\* I cannot face his sorrow and I write this calmly, but Oh ! the storm withm It is hard to submit to duty It is bitter to give up all the happiness of life at twentytwo It is wrong to say this for may not God have other joy in store for me and for him ? — but I cannot bear the idea of joy now 

On the last day of 1857 she steels herself to bear her sorrow, reminding herself of the greater suffering of her people in India during the Mutiny

Dec 31, 1857 Nearly gone and with it my hope? No, I cling to him I cannot yet give him up 1 My Max who loves me with the tenderness of a woman, and the strength of a man Oh f Lord may Thy richest blessing be with him now and ever, and grant me grace to see Thy hand in every event, and bow before Thee How many have lost relatives this year or suffered agonies for them, how many have endured mutilation and worse and shall I murmur at a grief which more or less seems to fall to nearly everyone ? 

She puts up this prayer at the beginning of 1858 

At sacrament today I prayed earnestly for grace to watch against and overcome the cross and bitter feelings that I know are in my heart My love for Muller should not have this effect on me No 1 God grant me strength to feel more for others, to mix more in their pursuits, and to quell the angry feelings that rise in my heart Doubt and disappointment are difficult to bear But am I domg myself and Muller justice by giving way to angry, even peevish feelings ? No, with God’s help they shall be conquered 

To illustrate her faith in God in her suffering I shall quote only one other entry, set down on May 1, 1859, and only twelve days before the event which was to make her father agree to her marriage with Muller ‘What would life be\*, she writes, £ if one could not take every care to God — little cares or worries which can be breathed to no human ear, but which one may lay before our heavenly Father, the gracious God to “whom all hearts be open, all desires known,” even when hardly known to oneself ’ 

This mingling of intense religious feeling with love shown by Georgina could be expected in mid-Victorian England, where faith was becoming more assertive and active than in the age immediately previous because of the growth of philosophic doubt and scientific disbelief But the devout high-seriousness which it generated was still exceptional in the upper classes, for whom worldlmess was an inheritance in entail 

The menfolk of the Grenfell family were of the normal type, and so Kingsley, Georgina’s uncle, was very glad to see that she and his friend were drawn to each other by a common spirituality, and he wrote to Max Muller 

You are one of the few men to whom I have been drawn passionately at first sight When I found out that you loved her, my affection for you 6 \* 



160 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

deepened I should have liked any man the better for loving her but that you did so, was quite a triumph to me, because I knew that it was not [her] face merely which would attract you but that you had seen the inward spiritual grace which I had always known was there, dormant chiefly, but only waiting to be called out 

He also loved Georgina the better for being attracted to Muller He had always thought well of her character and pictured her to himself, as he put it, ‘as the model lady-of-the-manor in a large estate’ But this showed her wisdom, xn that brought up as she was, she should see ‘how much better a noble human soul was for her than wealth or rank’ 

But even this did not reassure Kingsley that Georgina would be happy on the £750 that Max Muller had, and he wrote 

No doubt that people could be as happy as angels, even in this expensive England, on that But when children come, and come they will, fast enough and too fast — you would find that very little indeed True, hundreds of thousands of educated people will be rich on that, but you must remember what her bringing up has been — she never has had a physical want, or a fancy, unsatisfied since she was born — She would give up these and ‘rough it’, for herself, easily enough if she is a true woman, and find a joy and an honour in sacrificing herself for her children, and in that fact lies the danger Don’t tell me of not letting her make sacrifices She will never let you find her out — Oh my dear Max, you don’t know the diabolical cunning of women when they intend to be angels 

Kingsley also warned Muller against an alternative evil which was worse 

Her family see what her husband cannot, and then come endless presents You cannot refuse them, ought not but they are most galling to all valiant men She cannot refuse them because they will go to her children or enable her to save for her children, and so is established a habit of aristocratic pauperism which does no soul good And worse, it tempts her to get into the chronic habit of pleading poverty, giving hints, all but begging 

This would not have happened, Kingsley added, if she had no rich relations, but since she had, Kingsley concluded with a final word of advice. ‘Oh, Max, keep your feet and hers out of the net, and wait a while and all will go as God wills.’

Max Muller thanked Kingsley for his advice, saying ‘Your clear and decisive words have brought me more comfort than pam — they have driven away a swarm of vain hopes and plans, and the sooner they are scattered the better 5 But, as lover, he wholly rejected one part of the warning ‘Only one thing I must say If she is what I believe, and what you know her to be, all you write about aristocratic pauperism — true as it is and as I know it to be — applies as little to her as to Mrs Kingsley I share all your other fears, but this one I cannot share 9 

Whether Kingsley or Max Muller was right about Georgina on this score was never proved, because her father would not agree to the marriage even when in 1858 the emoluments of a Fellow of All Souls was added to Muller’s £750 or so But if she were put to the test she would have fully justified her lover’s confidence by never becoming an aristocratic pauper The stoicism with which she was bearing her sorrow at being forced to kill love for the sake of money, would not have left her if she had had love and little money She did not think it right even to indulge the sorrow Throughout the journal she tells herself that she must mope less, keep herself less aloof, and mix more with others in all their pleasures 

I have many many blessings — the love and approbation of so very many — a happy home, every temporal luxury and indulgence, so many dear ones round me I have many duties to perform, Father, aunt, brother, sister, servants and poor to comfort and influence I have great responsibilities — money, time and beauty to be well employed I have temptations — the peculiar foibles and sms of my own character, vanity, indolence, selfishness, the difficulties of my position — admired and spoilt , the little peculiarities of others to bear with quietly and kindly I have sorrows — one great, absorbing grief God grant I may read all its lessons aright When I look back I see such wasted time and talents, such forgetfulness of God When I look forward much seems dark and sad Let me cling to the ‘Now the present and the seen’ And here I would desire to live for others this year, help or comfort others I must strive that my own grief may not entirely engross me I must be often sad, for I would not leave Muller No 5 1 am too weak to resist the reaction I should then very likely make some foolish marriage, but I would be more alive for the sake of others to the duties, interests, and even pleasures of each day The poor and my own family must be my objects this year

But there lurked a great danger to Max Muller in the very fervent religious sensibility of the women of the Grenfell family He could be attacked through it, and attacked he was, though not by his rivals in love The attack came from Oxford The dons there always thought that the deeds of God were manifest in their worldly advancement, and they were given to making a ruthless use of the odium theologicum to strike down competitors Two of the greatest figures of nineteenth-century Oxford, Pattison and Jowett, were both harmed in their careers by this, and Max Muller was to be also He was rejected for a professorship To begin with, however, someone tried to spoil his prospects in marriage, and complained to Miss Grenfell that he was an unbeliever How serious the consequences of such a charge could be can be gusssed from the entry which Georgma Grenfell set down in her diary on October 8, 1856 ‘Dear Muller 1 I know God will bless him I saw on Sunday night some reports that Gommy had received as to his religious opinions, in which he was called an unbeliever These deeply grieved me, and I felt, intense as the struggle would be, I must give him up, if he could not refute such reports 5 

Fortunately, Max Muller came to know about it, probably through Kingsley, and though he was busy with his mother who was ill and needed to be attended by him because she did not know English, he at once wrote to Miss Grenfell 

I feel I ought to write to you, if it were only to say, Do not believe uncharitable reports You know that in England more than anywhere

else, and in Oxford again, more than anywhere in England, religion has been dragged into party struggles, and many persons think it neither uncharitable nor sinful to call a man a heretic or unbeliever who differ from them on matters, concerning not so much the doctrine, as the discipline and policy of the Church Though I have abstained as much as possible from mixing myself up with any party, yet I know that the very fact of my bemg made Professor at Oxford,\* has roused some angry feelings against me 

But he also honestly admitted that when he first came to Oxford he had spoken ‘rather strongly against those who, while they professed their faith so very loudly, seemed to be guided in their actions by principles so very different from those of Christianity\* Then he concluded with the words 

Nothing is more dangerous, and nothing more apt to bring out the worst features of a man's character, than religious controversy The more we can avoid it, the better for ourselves and for others Faith, Love and Honour, as the old knights used to say, are treasures of which those speak least who profess them And does it not seem to you, that, as our love to our neighbours has its springs in our love to God, so where there is faith in God, there is also faith in man ? I can say no more today 

It would seem that Miss Grenfell was not wholly satisfied by this, for in his second letter on this subject he quotes a passage from her reply in which she said T could not consent to the union of her whom I had above all things desired to tram as a Christian, with one who would lead her away from faith in the Scriptures, and dependence on the Divine Teacher and Redeemer \* This language hurt Muller very much, and he wrote an elaborate and almost panic-stricken apologia pro fidem suam to convince Miss Grenfell He began by telling her that it was impossible for him to defend himself if she did not believe him when he asked her not to believe m the accusation, and after that he dealt with his un-named accuser 

If I have said or written anything that has given offence to your friend, let me know it, and I shall then be able to defend myself But if someone, without giving any proof, without giving even his name, tells you

that I am an unbeliever, that I do not believe in the Bible, that I do not believe in Christ, our Lord and Saviour, I need not fear him I have many friends who know me and know my religious convictions, and though I have always avoided theological controversy, I have never avoided to express my faith in the doctrmes of Christianity where I felt called upon to do so 

Continuing, Max Muller said 

If you read the history of the Church you will find that all divisions and persecutions in the Church have arisen from the attempts of theologians to substitute their own thoughts and their own expressions for the simple language in which Christianity has been revealed to us in the Bible And if we know the dangers of religious controversy, if we see how it is opposed to the very spirit of Christianity and how it appeals to the worst passions, and destroys every feeling of charity, we ought to pity the priest or theologian who, like a physician, must enter into this pest house 

Max Muller’s plight was worse than that of Jowett when he was made to sign the Thirty-nine Articles Jowett was unrepentant and cynical As he wrote to Stanley, T have taken the meaner part and signed It seemed to me that I could not do otherwise without giving up my post as a clergyman ’ Muller could not afford such a mere formality It was bad enough to be rejected by the father for want of money, it would have been much worse to be rejected by the aunt for want of faith If he had known of Georgina’s attitude he would probably have been even more elaborate and earnest But as it was Georgina was wholly satisfied, and wrote in her diary after setting down her insistence on a refutation 

This he did in a letter that deepened my love to him, and made me feel more than ever that he would make me happy At the same time he said he had given up all hope of ever having me, and this made me feel I could not give him up 1 Therefore I have written and would wait in faith, prayer, and patience However it is, God will be with such a man, whose religious views are so deep and true, and in heaven if not on earth we may meet Dear Muller, I cannot cease to pray for him 

This true story of love is an example, among many others which may be found in the biographies of notable Europeans, of a relationship of which we Hindus can learn nothing at first hand —

namely, the relationship that exists between love in life and love in literature But a full documentation illustrating it can be found in Europe Georgina Grenfeirs journal, for instance, has shown me the counterpart in life of the confrontation between love and morality or society and also of the combination of love with stoicism which is found in all the novels of Charlotte Bronte Take Jane Eyre , for example Loving Rochester passionately, she ran away from him and set down her judgement even when she was suffering 

Which is better? To have surrendered to temptation, listened to passion , made no painful effort — no struggle , but to have sunk down in the silken snare , fallen asleep on the flowers covering it , weakened in southern climate, amongst the luxuries of a pleasure villa to have been now living in France, Mr Rochester’s mistress Whether it is better, I ask, to be a slave in a fool’s paradise at Marseilles — fevered delusive bliss one hour — suffocating with bitter tears of remorse and shame the next — or to be a village school mistress, free and honest, in a breezy mountain nook in the healthy heart of England ? 

In all this Madame de Stael is not dead, she is simply reborn in Yorkshire 

But stoicism, efficacious as it is in helping a man to suffer without cowardly wailing, is still a philosophy of defeat in life, in fact, the grandest philosophy of defeat It cannot prevent those who are young from suffering because their flesh remains quick and has not yet been tempered or annealed to endure the pain, so that young stoics feel as if they had chosen to have a surgical operation without anaesthetic Georgina was resolved to be heroic but felt in the same way At the end of 1857 s ^ e writes 4 The year nearly gone, and though the summer was bright and gay, yet all the year there has been a deep slow undercurrent of sorrow and anxiety \* I am so weary I long often for rest from it all like a tired child How will it end ?} Again she writes early in 1858 ‘All this tries me very much, and the spring time of life gone, and autumn seems gathering over without any summer I am very worn and weary, and long for rest/ At the beginning of 1 8 59, only a few months before the sudden happy turn in her life she sets down — ‘My twenty-third year gone. We bring our years to an end — so quickly they move from us and so fast does eternity draw on I thank God for the Past , and trust Him for the Future , only praying to serve Him in the Present' It is harrowing to read all this from a young girl of tw enty-three, but it is also

chastening to do so in an age given over to peevish self-pity and boastful self-indulgence 

What adds to her sorrow is hei knowledge that Muller also loves her and is suffering as much as she is She felt too that all his suffering was due to his love for a girl not wholly worthy of him She set down that conviction a few days after his declaration of love to her, and she reverts to the theme again and again ‘Except through deep love to him, I can never be fully, really worthy of him \* Are my worldly advantages to be for a moment considered as equivalent to his mind and character > The hollow, vam world may think them so, I never can ’ 

Another thing which was causing sorrow to her was the thought of the unhappiness of the other young men who were falling in love with her T am worried,’ she writes, ‘about C S I do hope he is not to be made unhappy by me — he is too nice, for me to suspect a feeling in him I cannot return, without being sorry and vexed about it ’ In about ten days she feels more positive and writes ‘I have begged papa not to ask C S here so often, as it is very evident what his feelings are ’ Six months later she felt that she could not allow this to go on, and she gave Charles Scrobold his conge in very great sorrow ‘Poor Charles Scrobold,’ she wrote on August n, ‘will have received the blow to all his hopes today I sent a message yesterday by Gommy to his mother, to say it was hopeless ’ 

There are references to other suitors, who were found on discreet inquiry by the aunt to be far far too poor to think of marrying Georgina often thought over in her mind if it would not be better under the circumstances to give up Muller and seek peace if not happiness in marriage In February 1858 she wrote in her diary ‘I feel sometimes that if some clever good man, whom I could respect, were to like me that would settle it But it would be a dreadful undertaking, and yet unless Papa consented to my union with Max I must either make that sort of marriage or remain single all my life — for my heart and youth and soul are with Max ’ Meanwhile, Max Muller had been suffering no less Actually, from the very morrow of his open declaration of love to Georgina he had ceased to hope For instance on July 3, 1856, less than a month from the declaration, he wrote to Miss Grenfell ‘How right you were when you said, Oh foolish man\* Yes, I have been extremely foolish, and I feel I have fully deserved the penalty which I pay. But it is too late to lament over it now ’

He concluded the letter by giving his promise that she would hear no more complaints, and by even setting down his appreciation of Riversdale Grenfell T wish I could tell Mr Grenfell how fully I appreciate his motives, and how much I value the kindness and forbearance which he has shown to me on all occasions \* 

But the extraordinary thing was that though everybody said that the matter was ended, nobody brought it to a conclusion For three years Muller and Miss Grenfell kept up this intimate and confidential exchange of letters, and Georgina saw some of them It was at the beginning of this correspondence that Miss Grenfell called for a vindication of Muller’s faith But why ? The Grenfells could have got rid of him finally by accepting the accusation at its face value without giving him any opportunity to justify himself, which, as has been seen, only deepened Georgina’s love for him But the midVictorian old maid continued to show affection and sympathy to Muller, and even consented to serve as an intermediary between him and her mece This would remain a puzzle unless one could revise one’s notion of a Victorian old maid 

Max Muller was equally despondent with others He confided in his intimate friend, Charles Kingsley, to whom he wrote on August io, 1857, from Leipzig 

I can wait and work — and sooner or later all this waiting and working will come to an end, for this life cannot last for ever and it will last no longer than we can bear it I have no right to complain I have all I wanted — more than I ever hoped for, more than I deserved A disappointment in love is hard to bear because it destroys our faith in ourselves and in everything else — a disappointment in marriage may be a life-long trial, but it need not destroy our faith in our own nature, in the truth of others, or in the wisdom of God I should like to see her once more before I go — but God knows best his season of blessings — and if I should never meet her again in this life, I feel that I owe to her more than I can tell you To say that it would have been better for me if I had never seen her, seems to be as foolish as to say, it would have been better for me if I had never been born No, no Life may grow more strange and awful every day — but the more it reveals to us its truest meanmg and reality, and the deepest depth of its divinity ‘And God saw everything that He had made, and behold it was very good ’ 

He kept Miss Grenfell informed about his work, his literary projects and campaigns, and told her on one occasion 



168 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

So you see I am in harness again, and I shall try to make up for the three years that I wasted in despair and misery Life was then a riddle, a foolish dream — I did not know for what purpose I should live and work It is so no longer, and the burden I shall have to bear, perhaps through the whole of my life, has become light and even dear to me since I know who wishes me to carry it 

But he can bear it only by thinking of the transcience of life T feel’, he says, ‘that much more than half of this earthly journey is finished — year after year seems to go more rapidly, and we shall have arrived sooner perhaps than we expect 5 He was then only thirtyfive years of age 

In reply to another letter of Miss Grenfell’s in which she had mentioned that it was being written while the Septet of Beethoven was being played in another room, he wrote 

Your letter written with the accompaniment of Beethoven's Septet was all music to me What is time and space, and earth and life, and all that people call stern reality ? While I was reading your letter I was sitting m a quiet corner of your room — watching the dark cedar tree that stretches out its broad branches to bless you and your house, and I listened to every note 

But to write in this way to the aunt of the girl whom one wants to forget was not the best means of ensuring that result Nor was it better to discuss lost love with her A small novel called The Lost Love had just been published and was very popular, and Max Muller sent it to Miss Grenfell, who read a personal note in it He replied at once, not unwilling to discuss the subject 

You cannot possibly allude to me when you say in your last letter speaking of a little book I sent you, that you hope there are not many such cases 1 But is there such a thing as a lost love ^ I do not believe it Nothing that is true and good is ever lost on earth though its fulfilment may be deferred beyond this short life Marriage is meant for this life only, but love is eternal, and all the more so, if it does meet with its fulfilment on earth. 

Max Muller did not take long to pass from the general to the concrete and in doing so wrote as the typical disinterested lover: 


As long as I imagined that the happiness of your dear niece depended

on her marriage with one so unworthy of her as myself, I sometimes feared that my mind would break down under the burden which God had placed on me As it is now, I feel relieved, because I know that she is happy and there may yet be greater happiness in store for her than she could have found as the wife of a poor man 

He even thought that Kingsley was wrong in assuring him that Georgina still loved him, as he wrote ‘Though Mr Kingsley no doubt meant very well in all he did, it was a mistake of his to imagine that it could be any consolation to me to be told that your mece, although she wished everything to be over, still entertained her deep affection This ought not to be It is different with a man whose heart is strong, and who can shape his life as he likes ’ 

After that the formal gesture of renunciation was bound to come, and it did in a postscript to this very letter, in which Muller wrote ‘Whenever you write to me again please to tell me distinctly that you have burnt all my letters I know they are safe with you, but those eyes for which alone they were written may be closed by the hand of God, and there is something sacred in the intimacy of friendship that ought to be protected against profane eyes 5 

In his very next letter, written nine days later, he informs Miss Grenfell ‘I have just burnt the last letters which I had kept — it was painful to read then again for the last time ’ But he is not sure that Miss Grenfell has done the same thing 

Miss Grenfell had certainly left the subject intentionally vague, having her own mind about the matter, and that has enabled me to document this part of Muller’s biography Muller convinced himself that he had found a compensation He wrote to Miss Grenfell ‘I hope you will some day come to All Souls and see me in my little cell I think you would agree with me that one may be very happy here — perhaps too happy I have found a home, a very pleasant home, as you will see when you come to Oxford 5 This exchange of letters continued She never withdrew her sympathy and good will from him, and Max Muller never ceased to be grateful Perhaps he would have been still more grateful if he had known that at one stage she had come forward with an offer to remove the money difficulty out of her own income There is no doubt that even if the marriage had not taken place Miss Grenfell would never have ceased to hold her place in his heart 

But it was neither Georgina’s love nor her faith which was to bring about her own and Muller’s release from suffering It was her

body which did that at last, by failing to bear the agony Some two months after she had set down her view of the tranquillizing effect of a loveless marriage, she saw Muller at a concert from a distance and fainted away Instead of feeling ashamed about this melodramatic weakness she gloried in it, and wrote in her diary as soon as she was strong enough to attend to it 

Last Thursday the 12th May I saw Muller at a concert It was agony I saw him come m, he only saw me at the end I always knew it would harrow up the very core of my heart whenever it happened and so it did So near, and yet so far off — no word, no sign between us, whose very souls cling so together Yet thank God it has happened, for it has undeceived myself and others, who fancied it was all over I have submitted so quietly, so cheerfully to my father’s stern will that many think that the sacrifice was light Few know how my whole life’s joy is gone He looked well and at peace God grant that it may really be so and give me grace to trust on £ A little longer’ and he and I shall meet where none can part us 

But that was not to be The doctor who was called in said that Georgina’s will to live was gone, and she would just fade away Both Kingsley and Froude advised Riversdale Grenfell to give his consent, and the father, who had never paid any heed to the mental suffering of his daughter, was frightened by the failure of her body He gave his consent 

So the trials of both Max and Georgina were drawing to a close On June 8, 1859, when on her way to Ray Lodge from Scotland she had reached Lichfield, Miss Grenfell wrote to Max Muller, apparently resolved not to lose a minute to give him the happy news 

My dear friend, This day three years you were very sad, and so were others, but there is a great change in the aspect of your lives — and I am allowed by my Brother to say that you will be welcome at Ray Lodge agam, and that we shall expect you there on Saturday next — your long patience and submission to what was hard to bear is to be rewarded, and it seems to be all like a dream Perhaps you have heard of my Brother having been in Oxford, or may have seen him there He does not tell me if this is so — but in a letter just arrived he says he withdraws his objection to your union with his beloved Georgie, and now I may say that I hope and trust it will be the object of you both to contribute m every way to his happmess — for he is (I may say it to you without the fear of offending you) making a sacrifice of his own views and feel-

mgs in thus consenting to what he opposed so long But so it is — whatever has brought it about, and now my dear friend you have a great treasure to take care of Oh may you guide and help her in all that is good, and holy, and in a word Chnstianlike 

You know my regard and affection for you, but you do not know what a difficult path I have had to walk m, so as to be kind and yet upright with everyone But all this is over now — May God realize all your happy expectations and give me the great blessing of seeing both these dear children happy for life Theodore and Charlotte are all joy Georgie is feeling rather stunned by the suddenness of the change After Saturday we shall feel quieter Let me have a Ime to say what time you are likely to arrive We are here on our way home from Scotland, and little thought what was awaiting us May God bless you 

She adds in a postscript ‘Remember you will have to take some care of me in my old age.’ Max Muller got the letter on the 9th and replied immediately. 

My dear friend, Here I have been sitting for hours, but I cannot collect my thoughts, much less can I write them down You must have patience with me, but such a sudden burst of light dazzles my poor eyes, and I hardly dare to trust them when I look at your letter I cannot understand it, I did not see Mr Grenfell when he was at Oxford I knew of his being here, and I felt keenly that he evidently did not wish to see me In moments like these we must be alone, quite alone with God I shall be more collected when I see you on Saturday, today I feel broken down in mind and body Do you know that so much happiness is very hard to bear? Do help me to bear it by sharing it with me 1 

Then after signing his name he remembered that he had not told her the time of his arrival So he wrote a postscript like Miss Grenfell, but with a more immediate application ‘May I come by the tram that arrives at Maidenhead at 11 25 

On the same day after arriving at Ray Lodge, Georgina set down in her journal ‘ “Thou dost all things well\*” Great joy given me God help me to bear it Papa removes his veto and Max and I meet the day after tomorrow “Tarry thou the Lord’s leisure, be strong and He shall comfort thine heart ,s \* 

At 11 25 Max Muller was going to arrive at Maidenhead station. Georgina was sitting in her room expecting him and she set down

m her diary ‘June n, 114am — I am waiting for my great joy God give me grace to bear it rightly ’ 

The next entry for the same day 

Max arrived at 2, and then we were together, really together, and the long three years since he put me into the carnage at Oxford rolled away like a dark dream All the others were out, and we sat together under the ilex tree and began to know each other and see how those three years had taught us and fitted us for our life together, how even m absence our souls had grown together, and I thanked God for His great love and mercy and for giving me such a soul to love and live for, to call mine for time and eternity In the evening he played to me — those sounds I had never thought to hear again We walked round by the river and stood long together at the gate at the back How happy 1 

The next day, Sunday, Max Muller wrote to Kingsley 

My dear Kingsley, Can you believe it ? I cannot, though I see her with my eyes I knew not that the world contained such happiness You know her, you know what treasure she is You know also what we have suffered, and now think of us, and pray for us to God that He may help us and teach us how to bear such joy and blessmg You are not angry with me ? Do not let us think of the past, it was so dark and awful, and the world around us is so happy and bright, there must be no cloud anywhere We shall meet on Tuesday I long to see my new dear aunt, — my old dear friend, Mrs Kingsley Oh this world of God is full of wonders, but the greatest wonder of all wonders is Love 

On this letter there is a short note in Kingsley’s hand Tor Georgie 5 And without a doubt Georgie saw it The wedding was to take place on August 3, nearly seven weeks later But the days passed almost in a delirium of joy for both, talking to each other, listening to Beethoven’s and Handel’s music, walking, attending church together, reading F, D Maurice and Keble and even the marriage service in advance I have already quoted some entries from Georgina Grenfell’s diary during this period which illustrate her ecstasy But I would still quote three typical ones The first of these describes how she took Max Muller to the grave of her long-dead mother at Taplow She writes T took him to my mother’s grave That fair young mother but little older than I am — could she but see us, she would be satisfied , Yes, that is 



BEATA GEORGINA 173 

the word — it is not mere bright happiness, but such entirely, utterly satisfied feeling This grows every day ’ 

The following entry was the last one before her wedding day 

Thursday 12 p in — Just in from the garden Oh\* how happy we have been , sitting under our own ilex, and next time we are together it will be as husband and wife What solemn words, yet how blessed ‘Oh\* God our Heavenly Father, Thou hast led us hitherto and ordered everything to this end Do thou still lead and guide us and enable us to offer ourselves our souls & bodies as a sacrifice to Thee, so that after training here on earth together, we may together dwell for ever with Thee, in a brighter world where nothmg changes or passes Amen ’ 

And on the morning of her wedding day she wrote ‘My wedding Day “Bless the Lord, oh my soul ” I go with perfect confidence and trust May God bless us both and may our lives be devoted to Him Amen\*’ 

After the wedding at Bray Church the newly married couple spent a week at Eversley Rectory lent by Kingsley, and then they went on a Continental tour, meeting Bunsen at Heidelberg, Max Muller’s mother at Dresden, his sister at Chemnitz, and visiting Bohemia, Switzerland and western Germany on their way back to Oxford, which they reached on October 24 Two months later she set down the last entry in her diary about her love affair and marriage\* 

Ray Lodge — X’mas Day, 1859 I have not written anything in this book in the last four bright months My life seemed too bright for words I am not disappointed Much as I had expected from my longloved Max I had no idea of half his value I cannot express his deep love, his tenderness, his forbearance Our three months abroad were mdeed happy and there began the hope of even greater joy for the future and tho\* God has destroyed that hope for a time, still intense happiness is showered on us Our joy is awful I can but pray that our good and gracious Father will bless our happy life now, to our real eternal good as I feel he did the years of sorrow that preceded it And here we are assembled, our whole party, well, bright, and with every blessing showered on us Gracious God, teach us all to remember Thee, as the author of all our blessings, and may we so pass through things temporal as finally to lose not the thmgs eternal Bless us for time and eternity 

How poor words seem How can they describe such joy as mine and 



174 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Max’s, how can they fitly express the hourly prayer, that I can truly say my grateful heart is always offering up, that we may both be God’s true servants and training together for an ever brighter higher life hereafter — ‘Thou God seest us ’ Thou dost know the thoughts, no need of our faltering words, when we approach Thee, our omniscient Father 

This fusion of human and divine love was one of the finest achievements of the Christian civilization of Europe, and it resulted in an exultant mysticism of the sex relationship Both have become things of the past in the world in which they were once created But even when this kind of love was a force in the life of European men and women, it could hardly be expected to be found in the lives of a German specialist on Sanskrit and comparative philology and an English girl belonging to fashionable society Appraisal of personal life is always baffling, because one can never discover fully what happens in its hinterland 

At this point I must describe a by-product of Max Muller’s disappointment in love It was a short novel or long story in German to which he gave the title Deutsche Liebe , German Love He wrote it m the autumn of 1856 when his mother was with him at Oxford, and it was published anonymously by Brockhaus of Leipzig in February 1857 I\* became very popular there, and before Max Muller’s death in 1900 went through twelve editions An English translation by one Miss Wmkworth was immediately published, and it was widely read There was also an unauthorized American translation which was very free, but it sold in very large numbers Georgina Grenfell, who knew and spoke German very well even before her marriage with Muller, made her own translation but it was not published for twenty years Then it was allowed to supersede the older translation because Max Muller thought that his wife’s translation more nearly gave the exact tone and colouring of the original and was more literal It was also translated into many other European languages A pocket edition was issued as late as 1913. 

The book seems to have appealed to some deep-seated and universal human mood and, as Mrs Max Muller wrote in 1909, it had been dearly loved by many in many lands Max Muller himself was particularly pleased that his novel had succeeded in winning friends among the hard-headed readers of the United States There is striking evidence of its appeal in a letter which he received from a total stranger in California in 1899, more than forty years after its

publication This American informed him that his wife had just died, and added ‘I want to tell you that your Deutsche Liebe lies upon her breast, in accordance with her wish I want to thank you on her behalf and my own, for that most beautiful story of spiritual affinity 9 

It is a story of love between a crippled German princess and a young commoner in a small German principality, and can be called a Ruritanian idyll except for its deep pathos I do not characterize the book as a tragedy because it is so instinct with the spirit of the Christian mystic and Quietist that no sense of any tragic catastrophe is created 

Max Muller himself explained why he had written it in a letter to Baron Bunsen 

What I wished to make clear to myself and others was, why with the inborn love to our fellow creatures, we could show that love to so very few of them only, why love had to be confined almost entirely to the members of our family, to our parents, our wife, our children, and why any attempt to go beyond generally ended in sorrow It is so, and we know not why, except again to show us that this life was not meant to be perfect, but only to give us by its very imperfections a faith in and a longing for a better life 

Froude in reviewing the book for the Saturday Review pointed out the historical position of this novel as another depiction of love 

One of our first impulses on seeing the general character of this work was to turn to the Bekenntnisse einer schonen Seele in Wilhem Meister , and to refresh our recollection of that remarkable production It was not without feelings of satisfaction that we laid down the volume of the great master and took up the one before us, reflecting how much half a century had done to elevate and purify the tone of society 

Max Muller himself had another contrast to Goethe in his mind To his mother, to whom he had not disclosed his authorship, he wrote ‘He [the author] only published the book because he thought that here and there it might do some good, and might cure young people of the epidemic of so-called unfortunate love The book contains the antidote to Werthers Leiden , and in so far is interesting 9 But he also adds ‘But it ought to have been more fully worked out to have much influence 9

The anonymity of the book was preserved for three or four editions, and then Muller came to be known as its author Bunsen was informed, and Fronde suspected the authorship 

The object of all this evasion seems to have been to avoid speculation as to whether the book contained a real personal story, and that story concerned the handsome young German don at Oxford But as soon as the fact of his authorship became known that was the very attribution which continued to be made So, in the preface to the sixth English edition published in 1898, Muller wrote T have received during the last forty years ever so many inquiries whether the book was autobiographical, and I have had to explain again and again that it was not, and why it was not I \* \* \* 5 \* \* \* He explained that it was only the idea of love with which he was concerned, and the story was no more than the frame in which it had to be set Love was a word, he added, ‘which has had many and often very conflicting meanings assigned to it, and which, I thought and still think, each man and woman has a right to define after his or her own heart 9 Mrs Max Muller, too, in her biography of her husband published m 1902, set down a final contradiction ‘So much has been written and said about this prose idyll, so many people have declared it to be autobiographical, that it is perhaps well once for all to say that it is pure fiction as far as the characters and circumstances are concerned 5 One wonders whether as she was writing this she recalled what she herself had set down in her diary on May 31, 1857. 

I have read Deutsche Liebe and know who it is by [She had assumed as 

a matter of course that the story was autobiographical ] I cannot feel 

anything but pleasure that Max should have loved that pure holy 

Grafin — it is like having loved and been loved by an Angel, and I feel 

that the sort of love he had for her, cannot, has not, lessened his power 

of loving me How after intercourse with her he could see anything in 

me to attract, I cannot guess When I think of Maria [the Princess 

m the story] I quite shrink at thought of my own weakness and 

nothingness But I can never doubt Max’s real love to me!
