WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 

Everything in Max Muller’s social antecedents, taken with his education which was typical for a young German of his birth and times, destined him for the career of an official or teacher But he exercised his own choice and launched himself into a vocation which, despite the feeling of uncertainty and groping he felt for many years, inevitably made him "the Erasmus of the nineteenth century Nevertheless the very first plan for settling him in the world envisaged an official’s life for him He was offered a position in the Austrian diplomatic service 

The source of the offer was romantic His mother had a cousin with whom the brother of the reigning Duke of Anhalt-Dessau, Prince Wilhelm, fell in love There was naturally a great outcry in the Ruritanian circle, but the Prince would not give up his love, and finally he was allowed to marry her morganatically However, she was raised from the position of a commoner by being made Baroness Stolzenberg, though to Muller she always remained Cousin Emilie This lady had as her childhood’s companion a mysterious individual who became known as Baron Hagedorn Nobody knew who his parents were His mother had given birth to him in a forester’s cottage near Dessau, and disappeared for ever He was brought to the house of Muller’s mother’s aunt, Frau Klausmtzer, and lived in her family as a schoolboy Thus he and Emilie became playfellows Hagedorn never did anything, but was never in want of money Large sums were paid annually for his maintenance by a Frankfurt banker. 

So his mam activity was to wander about Europe, and stay in the great capitals where he had comfortable apartments He had a large country house near Munich, and a prettily furnished flat in Rue Royale, opposite La Madeleine, though au cmqmeme . Once he took Max Muller on a tour of Germany 

Muller had not as yet taken his doctorate when Cousin Emilie and Hagedorn devised their joint plan for him He was to join the Oriental Academy in Vienna, in order to qualify for the Austrian diplomatic service by learning some Oriental languages As Cousin

Emilie and her husband the Prince were childless, they wanted to adopt him and give him a new name and also a title Furthermore, they offered to find a wife for him Max Muller shook his head, and without hesitation declined all the honours, he wanted to re main independent and true to his first love, Sanskrit All the decisive turns in his life were unexpected, almost accidental, but there did appear to be an inevitability in all that happened to him 

To begin with, Max Muller himself decided to go to Berlin and join the university there His object was partly to hear Franz Bopp, author of Comparative Grammar and the most eminent philologist of his age, and partly to study philosophy under Schelling He also wanted to examine the Sanskrit manuscripts which the King of Prussia had just bought from the executors of Robert Chambers, an English Orientalist Muller’s sister had been married in February 1844 to Dr Krug, a physician and son of the well-known philosopher, and they proposed to live at Chemnitz His own financial position was not such that he could take his mother with him to Berlin, and so it was decided that she should go and live with her daughter and son-in-law 

But even for himself Max Muller’s finances were not adequate. The scholarship of forty thalers (= £ 6 ) which he held was to last only one more year, and at his majority in 1844 his mother’s pension was going to be reduced from £ 1 5 a year to half that amount Therefore on his way to Berlin he stopped at Dessau in order to find out if he could obtain a grant from the Stipendium founded by Duke Leopold for poor scholars But no one gave him any hope The Duke and Duchess expressed a desne to see him, and he explained his position, but there was no practical result He then went to the family friend, Advocate Richter From him, too, he could get no hope At last he resolved to help himself, drew fifty thalers ( = ^7.50) from his savings bank, and started for Berlin 

He arrived there at the beginning of April, and at first stayed in the house of relatives, his uncle and Aunt Hake, who said that he could stay with them as long as he liked He gratefully accepted the offer, but began to look for lodgings at once. He wanted a really nice room, and informed his mother that in two days he had seen forty, and was dead tired. He explained that he could not pay any visits until he was settled, but added in despair: ‘But when will that be ? ’ However, in two days he found a room very near the Unter den Linden, becoming the lodger of a cobbler. He paid 18 shillings a 



[[40]]

month for the room, service and cleaning of boots, and found the people of the house to be clean and respectable 

Rut the cobbler's workshop was next to his room, and the beating of leather went on all day long and tried his patience very much However, the room was on the third floor and commanded a wonderful view To look at it was a solace to him, and he held out against the noise 

In Berlin he had access to influential persons Though the Duchess could not help him about money, she had given him an introduction to Alexander von Humboldt More significantly, she asked him to see Ruckert, the famous poet and Orientalist Max Muller's father and he were friends, and Muller himself was very fond of Ruckert's poetry, which he had read since boyhood But he had a fair warning that the man might be different from the poet Before he left Dessau the Duchess told him ‘When you go to Berlin you must see Ruckert, but don’t be frightened ' 

Max Muller found Ruckert to be the broad-shouldered giant described to him, and, besides when he went to see the poet, he was m his dressmg-gown, with his hair parted in the middle and hanging wildly about his temples The opening of the acquaintance did not promise well When Max Muller requested the professor to enrol him for the lectures on the Persian poet Saadi and his Guhstan , he was asked ‘Why do you want to learn Persian He humbly explained his reason, but Ruckert observed ‘It is no use your learning Persian unless you know Arabic ' Muller said that he had studied Arabic for a year under Professor Fleischer at Leipzig But the real reason for Ruckert’s unwillingness was that he was anxious to get away from Berlin to his country place, Neusses, near Coburg, if only he could find a good excuse for not lecturing to give to the Minister of Education, who grumbled at his absences So he said to Muller ‘You know tres faciunt collegium ’ (without three there cannot be a class), and he added, ‘I cannot lecture for one ’ Muller went away to find two more listeners, and came back with them, making up the required three All of them said to the professor that they were most anxious to learn Persian. One of them really wanted to learn the language, and indeed subsequently became a great scholar, the other was only a makeweight Seeing no way out, Ruckert agreed to remain in Berlin and give his lectures. 

Nevertheless, when lecturing he told them that he had forgotten his Persian, and confessed. ‘I cannot teach you Persian. 



[[41]]

I can only show you how to learn it I learned everything by myself, and so can you We will work together, but that is all I can do ’ 

Muller found that Ruckert’s informal teaching was more useful than that of many learned professors who year after year read the same lectures to admiring audiences Ruckert was extremely adventurous in his linguistic excursions Nobody in Germany in those days thought of learning Tamil, but he showed Muller a large treatise on Tamil which he had himself copied and amended He also studied Chinese, and was fairly advanced in Sanskrit and Zend According to Max Muller, the secret of success of the German professors was that they took their pupils into the worshops and did not keep them standing and gaping at the show window Something like the tutorial teaching at Oxford and Cambridge was given by the German professors in the seminars and societies, where the students were shown how to work rather than simply crammed for examinations Afterwards Ruckert learned that Max was the son of his friend Wilhelm Muller, and he became very friendly to him Treated with cordiality and admitted to intimacy, Max Muller felt that it was a privilege to know him 

Max Muller’s acquaintance with Bopp was not so fruitful He received Muller most kindly, but was very infirm though only fiftythree yeais old In his lectures he simply read his Comparative Grammar with a magnifying glass, and added very little that was new He lent some Latm manuscripts to Muller, but could not help him with the really difficult passages This at first surprised Muller, for he had assumed that every professor was omniscient Then he realized that even at fifty-three a scholar might foiget many things he had known 

He paid more attention to Schelhng, and attended his course of lectures more diligently He saw the philosopher as soon as he could after his arrival in Berlin, and sent an account of the first meeting to his mother. Muller was an obscure student not yet twenty-one, and the other was a famous philosopher of sixty-mne. He had heard that Schelhng also could be abrupt with his visitors. But he was received kindly, and when after the preliminary talk about his lectures and Muller’s own interests the subject of Indian philosophy came up, the eminent elder allowed the younger man to tell him a good deal Muller dwelt especially on the likeness between the Samkhya system of Hindu philosophy and Schellmg’s 



[[42]]

own system, and remarked how an inclination to Vedanta also showed itself , 

Schelhng asked him more about this He was specially interested m knowing what the Vedanta said about the existence of God, how it proved His existence, whether it said that God had created the world, and also whether it said that the world had any reality He was at that time very much occupied with the essays of the English Orientalist Colebrooke, and wanted to learn more, even asking Muller if he could explain a text At last he inquired where Muller lived, told him that he had known his father as a poet who had written on Greece and worked on Homer, and dismissed him with a cordial 4 Come again soon\* Muller attended Schelhng’s lectures, and even translated a portion of one of the Upanishads for him The first few months of Mullet’s stay in Berlin were very pleasant socially. His connexions, the Hakes and the Krugeis, regularly asked him to meals, and as his friend he had Fontane, once a fellowstudent at Leipzig He met his teachers from time to time, and even visited Bettina von Armm, one of the Egenas of the Romantics But his closest friends were the Hensels, particularly the artist’s wife, Fanny, who was the favourite sister of Mendelssohn They always sent him invitations, and he went to them more often than he could really spare the time He described one of his early visits in a letter to his mother 

I went at twelve, for a large musical matinee , they sang the choruses of Antigone Then I stayed in the garden with the tutor, and we played with Hensel a sort of ninepins , then came dinner, and they asked me to return in the evening, as Oehlenschlager, the German poet, was coming to them, so I spent nearly the whole day there I have not played there yet, as she has not asked me to do so, but when I told her I wanted to hire a piano, cheap but not bad, she offered to lend me an English one, on which she used to play He, too, is most friendly. 

As to his studies, they were more desultory than concentrated. He attended lectures on many languages and subjects, and even matriculated in theology His mother felt glad that he was not working too hard, but he wiote in his diary ‘Worked early, but could not concentrate Dreaming, and a little poetry, and very little work I must work more in future ’ Even in respect of Sanskrit, on which he wanted to specialize, he could not get permission to lead the manuscripts at home until many months later von Humboldt 



[[43]]

intervened for him But he made translations from Sanskrit, read Pali and Hindustani, and learned the elements of Bengali by himself What distracted him was anxiety about money combined with total unceitainty about the future His scholarship was small enough, but even that was going to be stopped at the end of a year. At first, to economize, when not asked out he dined at a restaurant which supplied a dinner, considered good by him, for only sixpence Later he lived on only bread and butter at home, and coffee without milk or sugar In the diary which he kept then such entries as ‘no dinner’ 01 ‘dinner of scrambled eggs’ (prepared by himself) occur frequently Despite all this, he wrote to his mother that he was doing well and nothing was wanting to him except his dear little mother He even admonished her ‘Don’t say again you do not like Chemnitz — a contented spirit is happy anywhere ’ 

He could struggle with poverty but he saw no end to it, and was troubled by doubts whether the vocation he had chosen of scholar was likely to lead anywhere On June 26, less than three months after his arrival in Berlin, he wrote to his mother. 

Where I am to go next Easter is not at all certain I hesitate between Pans, Vienna, and Bonn I am attracted to Vienna by the thought of studying Persian and Turkish, for which there are better means there than in Pans, and they are certainly necessary should I ever have the chance of employment in the East You can fancy that these plans often disturb me, as for the nearest futuie I have no certain prospect, and the umveisity course is so expensive and wearisome, that I cannot reckon on it, as generally for the first three years, that is six years after leaving school, one is not admitted to anything' Well, one must console oneself with the lilies of the field’ 

Two days latei he set down in his diary ‘I cannot give up Sanskrit, though it holds out no prospect for me ’ Two months later he reached even a deeper level of dejection and wrote to his mother: 

I am longing to be away from Berlin, to get a thorough change of thought, as I really think I have every chance here of becoming a confirmed hypochondriac. This is no mere transitory feeling, but it is founded on my circumstances, which have cost me many sad thoughts latterly I acknowledge that the plan of life I had formed is not to be realized; that it is difficult for me to part with all these favourite ideas you can well imagine And yet it would be folly in my circumstances to attempt a university career. 



[[44]]

His mother had assured him that he still had 800 thalers (= £ 120 ), the money left by his father to start him in life But Muller told her that it would last only until he had settled where to live, and thus he would continue to study and starve, in order not to relinquish an idea which he had taken up for his own pleasure and for which he had sacrificed much money and time He added, with injustice to himself, that if he had more courage and a firmer point to cling to, he could perhaps still try his luck, but as things were nothing remained for him but to become a sensible schoolmaster, and this at least would give him bread and butter 'You will find/ he commented, 'that a certain amount of resignation is needed for such a decision ’ 

For the moment he was cheered by the prospect of seeing his mother and sister, for he was going home for his vacation and for a respite from all his anxieties Early in October he returned to Berlin, and was relieved to get the news that the Duke had extended his mother’s full pension for five years, writing to her T hope that your promising son may continue to give you as much cause for joy as hitherto ’ But his depression returned, and he wrote to his mother. 

I hope you make yourself as happy in the backstream of life as I do As I sit here in my garret and for days together see no one I know, I fancy myself as a bird alone in its nest on a tall tree, and Leipzig, Chemnitz, and Dessau appear perfect Eldorados But I am quite happy and amuse myself, by myself, as far as possible Well, I have enough for the present, and I think of the birds in the sky They have no fire, yet they don’t freeze, but I do freeze 

Relief came to Max Muller within a month or so in the shape of his capricious friend, Baron Hagedorn He suddenly appeared in Berlin, and invited Max to stay with him in Paris and carry on his Sanskrit studies Max immediately fell in with the proposal, and on his twenty-first birthday, December 6, 1844, wrote to hus mother\* 

My dearly loved Mother, As I am sitting here quite alone on my birthday I must give myself at least the delight of writing to those who love me so, and whom I dearly love And first of all comes my darling little mother My best thanks for your love and goodness, which in many thmgs are far too great I wish I could see you, darling mother, and talk over all the unexpected and undeserved kindness that has been 



[[45]]

shown me I went Thursday early to Hagedorn, and we talked over everything, and the result is he has asked me to go to Pans with him , to live with him there and work So in about four weeks from today I shall be in Pans Hagedorn will tell you all this hims elf more fully 


As it happened, at that time another choice was open to him Baron J von Bunsen, then Prussian Minister in London, had heard about Muller from Humboldt as well as from Baroness Stolzenberg, and he at once wrote to his English friend, Archdeacon Hare, asking whether he could think of any openings for a young German who was at twenty-one already a distinguished scholar and wanted to live for some years in England As a result, there came an offer to go to London as tutor in an English family Muller was in great indecision for some time, but finally decided in favour of Paris and pleasant independence 

But Hagedorn disappeared, and Max Muller had to go in pursuit to Dessau, where he was dawdling At last he settled everything, and on February 26 set out with Hagedorn for Pans At Cothen the train was stopped by snow and they had to return to Dessau, where Hagedorn found business letters awaiting him which kept him there. So Max Muller set out alone, and after a number of halts arrived in Paris at three o’clock on March 10, 1845 

The arrival was an unsolicited adventure Hagedorn’s address was given to him as 25 Rue Royale St Honore, but he had forgotten the word Royale, and had himself driven in a fiacre to 25 Rue St Honore The concierge stared at him, told him that no Baron Hagedorn lived there, and suggested he try 25 Faubourg St Honors, where the same scene was repeated. It was a rainy afternoon, and Muller was both tired and hungry He was being taken along the Boulevard des Itahens, when looking out of the window of the carnage he saw a familiar figure on the pavement, an old acquaintance from Dessau, a half-French half-German hunchback named Gathy who was a student of music under his own teacher and had become a musical writer in Pans. ‘Gathy, Gathy!’ Muller cried out, rescued from his despair, and jumping down told his story Of course Gathy knew both Flagedorn and his apartments, and guided Muller to the proper place. The concierge was prepared for him, and took him to the cmqmeme. He lay down exhausted on a sofa and cried out in what Fiench he could command: ‘Donnez-moi quelque chose a manger et a boire. ’ That took some time, but food was 



[[46]]

brought, and restoung himself Muller discussed the most necessary matters with Gathy 

The immediate problem was money Depending on Hagedorn, Max Muller had brought very little with him, and there was no Hagedorn But Muller remembered the name of a friend of the Baron’s who was with Rothschilds, and went over to the bank This man too was away, but another bank official told him that he could have as much money as he wanted until the Baron himself or his friend returned Then came the larger question of financing his whole stay in Paris Muller was to have stayed with Hagedorn, but throughout his sojourn in Pans his friend never came there So, apart from rent, he had to bear all his own living expenses The free lodging was an immense advantage, but still he needed 100 francs a month for food and service, without taking into account lighting, heating, laundry or clothes His situation in Paris was worse than in Berlin 

He had breakfast of bread and butter without coffee, and dined at the Palais Royal for two francs This he found too expensive, and discovered that beyond the barrier, where there was no octroi, he could eat much more cheaply Yet the problem remained of providing his daily bread while eking out what money he had for the longest possible stay in Paris T am spending a lot of money,’ he wrote within days of his arrival , and less than a month later in a letter to his mother he reverted to the theme ‘How gladly I would have put something in the letter for Auguste’s [his sister’s] birthday from the Pans shops, for the sight of the splendid and tastefully arranged windows is most tempting But, alas 1 my purse suffers from chronic consumption, you know this family complaint, which has followed me to Pans ’ Within another month he again wrote ‘One’s money runs away here, one does not know how, and though of course it costs one more in the beginning, the daily wants do not lessen That I am saving as much as I can you may be sure, for it is my greatest wish to stay here as long as possible, where I have found so much necessary to my studies ’ 

He got offers of help from friends, but refused them He had at times to borrow money to tide over a temporary difficulty, but he never did so unless he knew that some money due to him would soon arrive He could also give private lessons, but he had a strong dislike of that kind of drudgery. In fact, once he got a very handsome offer to go with Baron von Cetts, the Bavarian Minister to 



[[47]]

London, as tutor of his children, all expenses paid and 3,000 francs a year But the Minister required a promise that Muller would never leave his children even for an hour, and such a condition appeared so degrading and foolish to him that he declined He wrote to his mother 


It was a substantial position, which would free me from many disagreeable things, and in which, instead of taking money from you, my dearest mother, I could have given you some little pleasure But it was impossible, unless I sacrificed my whole future, and wasted the little I have already done, and I hope that as I feel I have little to reproach myself with, I shall not be blamed by others 

What he would do to earn money was to copy Sanskrit manuscripts for the Orientalists who wanted copies Even this meant very hard work, and his plan was to sit up the whole of one night, take three hours’ rest the next night without however undressing, and then take a full night’s rest, and repeat the sequence This was not good for his health He suffered both in body and in mind, and at times felt very lonely and homesick, all the more so because of his strong attachment to his mother He often wrote about it, for example, on April 10 ‘You can fancy that in this utterly strange land I sometimes feel lonely and forsaken, and would gladly find myself for a few hours in Chemnitz with you ’ But he also knew that the poverty as well as the separation was of his own choice At the end of his life he wrote in his autobiography ‘It was, indeed, a hard struggle, far harder than those who have known me in later life would believe It was a hard fight, and cannot have been good for me physically, but I do not regret it now.’ He told himself that he had mapped out his course of life and, as he added ‘It was in my own hands whether I should swim or sink ’ 

He kept his resolution and swam, but it was at first like the swimming of a shipwrecked sailor who clings to a plank without seeing anybody near him, and then suddenly catches sight of a rescuing boat\* All the early openings in his career came unexpectedly, and were almost like windfalls While waiting for them he sought relief from his anxieties in work, and for his sorrow at separation from his family in religion and philosophy As he wrote to his mother 


Separation loses its bitterness when we have faith in each other and in God. Faith in each other keeps us close together in life, and faith in 



[[48]]

God keeps us together in eternity But I see I am talking Sanskrit philosophy instead of simply telling you not to be unhappy, not to make yourself and others uneasy, but try to enjoy life in this lovely spring weather, whether in Chemnitz or Dresden [Or again] But enough of these lamentations, which are of no use, least of all in Paris Melancholy and frivolity are the two scales in which men here go up and down , happy he who sits in the middle quiet and observant as an Indian Muni [Sage] 

Max Muller was only twenty-two when he wrote that, and was amazed to find that he was so old 

There was however something deeper in his moods of dejection than could be accounted for by their apparent and tangible causes, such as lack of money, separation from family and friends, struggle to make a career and great uncertainty over it Even when he was happily settled and prosperous at Oxford, sudden fits of depression and restlessness would come over him. But such swings are habitual to those who begin life and spend their first years in an environment which is socially and culturally stable, and then take the road to other worlds in which they can never again take root 

But it is wrong to say that they become mentally, socially, or culturally deracme On the other hand, they can develop a very high capacity to assimilate themselves into any environment and move naturally in it This is true cosmopolitanism, which in spite of its 
- diverse elements is a stable, though compound, product. The unity 
of such lives is that of harmonic and contrapuntal music The basic strand in it is always the deep bass of the early environment, punctuating the other melodic lines and sometimes surging above them. Then comes the middle register of work and woikaday life, and, above all, there is the treble line of creative moods and moments of revelation, all accompanied by the trills and other decorative figures of sense experience Such a life is no more ill-orgamzed than a symphony But it is not easily put together. 

However, the initial homesickness is made more painful if a man has migrated from a small town 01 village. It is these men who feel most cruelly the truth of the saying that a great city is a great desert Muller had come from Dessau, and even at Leipzig his life was not different in kind But when he went to Berlin, Paris and London, he saw an agglomeration of people and not a community He suffered cruelly at this contrast. 

But of course the other parts of his mmd remained active, and he 



[[49]]

could amuse himself with what he saw As he wrote to his mother ‘For interesting observation there is no place like this ’ Only he wished his mother there too At first he took to that absorbing occupation of a visitor, Flaner a Pans , lounging about in the city and taking in its outward beauty, and also taking delight in the rush and bustle of the streets The contrast of such scenes with the quiet of Dessau and Leipzig made him laugh out loud Soon after his arrival he found that the days which, in the serious world, were called Holy Thursday and Good Friday, were known as Longchamps m Paris, and he saw magnificent equipages, ladies in splendid dresses and well-groomed gentlemen, driving out through the Champs Elysees to the races 

Muller had come to Paris in the last days of the Orleamst Monarchy, when the middle-class regime created by the July Revolution fifteen years before had become stagnant but had not yet provoked another revolution In the Place du Carrousel at only twenty paces from himself he saw the bourgeois King Louis-Phihppe as he was riding with his whole suite to watch the craze of the day, the midget General Tom Thumb, who held receptions in Rue Richelieu and drove out in his carriage the size of a child’s go-cart 

Life in Paris did not then have the garishness it acquired under the Second Empire But it had its lurid lights. Muller saw some of these When dining hors de la barnere he once noticed a strange lady sitting not very far from him, and learned that she was the wellknown Louve of Eugene Sue’s Mysteres de Pans, or, in other words, she belonged to the Orleamst prototype of the world of ToulouseLautrec At the end of his stay he went to a masked ball at the Opera, which he described as odious, full of vulgar people, wretched di esses, noise, tumult and at the end drunken stupor for all But the music, he added, was excellent 

He also saw the flaming comet of the day, the actress Rachel in Racine’s Phkdre He described what he saw to his mother ‘From the beginning to the end Rachel was nothing but a pale shadow whose only life is passion and despair, but passion which fails in all tragic effect because it has no influence on one’s feelings. It is a crude and painful passion with which she is possessed, and in which there is nothing to awake our sympathy ’ 

But the most exceptional experience Muller had in Paris was his acquaintance with a wealthy Bengali from Calcutta, who was creating as great a sensation in the French capital as Dumas’s Count 



SO SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

of Monte Cnsto He was Dwarkanath Tagore, fathei of Debendranath Tagore, the religious reformer, and grandfather of the great Indian poet, Rabindranath Tagore, the only Indian to have received the Nobel Prize for Literature He had taken the best suite in one of the best hotels of Pans, and was spending lavishly Not only did King Louis-Philippe receive him, he even came with his court to a grand party given by Tagore, who had the room hung with real Cashmere shawls, then the ambition of every fashionable woman, and as she left placed a shawl on the shoulders of every lady. 

Tagore had been told that Muller had already copied and collated the MSS of the Veda in Pans, and so showed lively interest in the young German, inviting him to his hotel Muller went there often, and spent the mornings discussing India and Indian customs, and also practising English and Bengali He discovered that Tagore was very fond of music, was in fact an accomplished musician himself, and had acquired a taste for Italian music 

One day Muller asked him to sing something Indian, and Tagore at first sang a Persian song Max Muller did not want to hear that, but genuine Indian or Hindu music Tagore smiled and turned away, saying 'You would not appreciate it ’ But as Muller went on pressing, he sat down at the piano and accompanying himself began to smg Muller could discern neither melody, nor rhythm, nor harmony in what he sang When told this, Tagore shook his head and said 'You are all alike If anything seems strange to you and does not please you at once, you turn away When I first heard Italian music, it was no music to me at all , but I went on and on, till I began to like it, or, what you call, understand it.’ 

Then he began a general homily 

It is the same with everything else, [he went on] You say our religion is no religion, our poetry no poetry, our philosophy no philosophy We try to understand and appreciate whatever Europe has produced, but do not imagine that we despise what India has produced If you studied our music as we do yours, you would find that there is melody, rhythm, and harmony in it, quite as much as in yours And if you would study our poetry, our religion, and our philosophy, you would find that we are not what you call heathens or miscreants, but know as much of the Unknowable as you do, and have seen perhaps deeper into it than you have! 

He became very eloquent, and so excited that Max Muller pacified 



[[51]]

him by saying that he was quite aware that India possessed a science of music founded on mathematics 

This speech of Tagore’s has a profoundly significant historical importance as one of the earliest utterances of the polemical position of modern Indians against their British rulers and detractors These Hindus were accepting the West and rediscovering their ancient civilization at the same time, and creating a liberal nationalism based on a cultural synthesis to which the British never had an effective answer Max Muller was to remain in touch with this nationalism all his life 

He also found another expression of both liberalism and nationalism in Dwarkanath Tagore and that was in his cynicism towards the Brahmins and also towards what he called the ‘black-coated Brahmins’, the Anglican clergy 

The dislike which Dwarkanath and all Hindu nationalists felt for English clergymen, in spite of their sincere admiration for so many other things English and also their gratitude for what the missionaries were doing for India in the way of education, was due to the fact that these men aired, in the most arrogant and frigid form, the moral superiority which the British in India felt towards the natives Thus Dwarkanath, who read many English newspapers, copied out m a sort of black book he kept all the reports which did not redound to the credit of any bishop, dean, or priest, and he took great delight in bringing out this collection of every kind of ecclesiastical scandal whenever the talk turned on the respective merits of the Hindu and the Christian religions Max Muller could only reply that no religion, whether in Italy, England, or India, should be judged by its priests. 

Muller had opportunities to meet the foremost literary and intellectual figuies of France of that epoch through Baron d’Eckstein, who gave him plenty of work in the way of copying Sanskrit manuscripts and paid him liberally, thus helping him to keep financially afloat in Paris Eckstein was a notability in Pans, and had acquired his position as a propagator of Hindu wisdom and as an intermediary between Hindu thought and spirituality and the greatest writers of the day. He offered to introduce Muller to George Sand, Lamennais, Daniel Stern (Comtesse d’Agoult), Lamartine, Victor Hugo and others. But Muller had neither the time nor the money to take part in social life, nor did he have the inclination to make formal calls on celebrities. But he regretted it afterwards, and said that 



[[52]]

one result of his seeing so little of French life was that his spoken French remained imperfect 

But in connexion with his own interests he was bound to meet French Orientalists, both old and young, and he moved in their set His first desire was to meet Burnouf, whose works he had read and for whom he had acquired a very great respect But he did not know his address, and had to wait until Gathy discovered it for him He then summoned up his courage and called on him When he walked m he found a dear old gentleman in his dressing-gown, surrounded by his books and his four little daughters who were helping him to collect and arrange alphabetically a number of slips on which he had jotted down whatever had struck him as important in his reading during the day Muller saw that the scholar was small, with a face that was decidedly German but became distinctively French when lighted up by a sparkle Burnouf could hardly understand Muller because his French was very poor But he showed him a civility such as he had not met with before He inquired warmly after his German teachers, Brockhaus, Bopp and Lassen, and even mentioned a small book which Muller had written. He told him that he might attend his lectures in the College de France, and added that he would be most happy to give him any advice or help he wanted Muller at once felt perfect trust in him, and was aux cieux , as he put it, to have found such an adviser Muller attended the lectures which Burnouf gave on the first book of the Rig-Veda as published by Rosen, and discovered Burnouf was a different type of lecturer He had a small and select audience of young scholars like Roth and Goldstucker who were to become great specialists in Sanskrit, and also older men like Barth&emy St Hilaire, once a Minister of Foreign Affairs in France, and the Abbe Bardelli He would explain his method, give his students all the new information he had collected and make them his fellow-workers All this Muller found to be very inspiring, more especially because Burnouf was very generous in his approval and if his pupils found out anything new he was delighted to give them full credit for it. They all worked as a team, exploring, mapping out and prospecting a new and unknown country — which indeed the world of Oriental scholarship then was It was in Pans and at the express direction of Burnouf that Max Muller finally canalized his Sanskritic studies into the highly specialized research project which was to gam recognition for him

m the world of scholarship that of editing and publishing the Rig-Veda , the oldest scripture of the Hindus 

While working on the manuscripts of the Rig-Veda in Pans he often felt the want of some essential manuscripts which he knew were in the library of the East India Company in London, and therefore he wished to go over to consult them Rut he did not have the money even to make the journey, far less for a stay At last, in June 1846, when he was six months short of being twenty-three, he scraped together enough for a flying trip Though Muller could not afford to cultivate the celebrities of Paris, he had made many personal friends, among whom were not only fellow-workers in the Oriental field but also a Duchess and a Countess, both of whom were musical and made much of him These and others, including Burnouf, gave him farewell parties, and many of them came to the post-house to see him off He left Paris at 5 pm on June 9, and arrived at Boulogne by the diligence at 1 1 a in the next day He had never seen the sea before, and the sight of the wide, dancing expanse excited him so much that he hardly had the patience to go into the hotel, but set off at once for a long walk along the shore, and wandered about for five hours until forced to return by sheer hunger. 

At ten o’clock that night he went on board the ship which was to take him direct to London It was almost full moon, and he remained on deck taking in the beauty of the scene. But soon a rough passage brought on an onset of seasickness, and turned his delight into misery A young Englishman, who was a fellow-passenger, found him holding on to the stays, trying to resist the attacks, and watched him with interest This was William Howard Russell, who was to become the most famous war correspondent of his time, and was then working for The Times as well as studying law 

In the morning, once the ship had entered the Thames, Muller recovered Russell saw a young man with regular features, fine intelligent eyes, most engaging expression, thick, dark hair but no trace of whiskers, beard or moustache, neatly dressed in a suit which showed his erect, slight, but well-built figure to advantage. The melancholy expression of the previous night had vanished from his face, and he was standing with an alert air and penetrating gaze When a question from him to another passenger produced a misleading answer, Russell stepped up and gave the true explanation Then they became acquainted Muller said that he was going to 



[[54]]

London to pursue his studies in Oriental literature, and Russell said that he was a law student in the Middle Temple At the Customs House above Blackwall Muller found that his portmanteau with all his worldly goods, and particularly his papers and letters, had not arrived He was in a panic and told Russell that if it was lost that would be ruinous to him The luggage of all the passengers was gone over again, but there was not a trace of the missing trunk Seeing Muller’s distress Russell offered to take him to his chambers, give him a shakedown for the night, and come back the next day to look for the box Very much moved, Muller accepted the offer, was driven to the Temple, and after dining at Andertons m Fleet Street, went to sleep on a comfortable couch and in a sleeping suit provided by the laundress The next day Russell and Muller went back to the Customs House and found the trunk, and Russell secured a decent bedroom for him at io$ a week at the house of a tailor in near-by Essex Street Max Muller settled himself in, and in two days had seen Hyde Park, St James’s Palace, Westminster, St Paul’s and the Tower, besides calling on Professor Wilson to obtain permission to examine manuscripts in the library of the East India Company 

During the first months of his stay in London Muller and Russell met almost every day In those days students could take friends to their rooms after dimng in hall at the Temple Muller was always a welcome guest at Russell’s, and he provided novel and exhilarating entertainment by singing, Edite , bibite, conviviales, Cramambuh and other studentenheder Those who had rooms at the Temple were eager to secure a special right to one performance, which was always applauded and encored. That was O Tannen - baum, O Tannenbaum an imitation of the whole orchestra, trumpets, drums, bassoons and what not, delivered with the greatest perfection 

Russell as a newspaper reporter got free tickets to concerts and theatres, and the two went night after night to Drury Lane, the Haymarket, the Adelphi, Her Majesty’s, Covent Garden and others Muller’s enjoyment of the opera was intense, and after seeing the Italian opera he wrote to his mother \* 

A friend took me to the Italian Opera, which I had not yet seen either here or in Pans It was wonderful A larger house than I have ever seen, and every one in full dress The boxes filled with the nobility, 



[[55]]

and I saw Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the Duke of Cambridge, etc The music absolutely perfect, Anna Bolena , sung by Gnsi, Mario and Lablache, all the highest artistic perfection And then a ballet to which there can be nothing equal, and Jugement de Pans with Taglioni, Grahn, and Cento as the three goddesses The decorations were beautiful 


Muller’s work in London offered no difficulty Wilson at once gave him permission not only to examine the manuscripts, but even to take them home On the very first day he invited him to dinner Muller also paid visits to the British Museum, and made pleasant acquaintances there 

His first great difficulty was with English, which he could not speak well enough to make himself easily understood He wrote to his mother that he hoped to improve, and his struggles with the language began soon enough The morning after he had moved into his room in Essex Street, his landlady came in to inquire how he had slept, and then put another question ‘But, sir, don’t you want another “pillar” Muller’s bed was an immense four-poster, and as he had never seen such a structure before he had been in constant fear the previous night that the top would fall upon him and smother him Bewildered by his landlady’s pronunciation, he looked at the posts of the bed and asked in his turn ‘Why, what shall I do with another pillar, and where will you put iU’ She then touched the pillows on the bed and said, ‘Well, sir, you shall have another “pillar” tomorrow ’ Muller said to himself ‘How shall I ever learn English if a “pillar” means a soft pillow 

But his greatest problem was still money Fie found that his German money did not go far in London, and he thought of supplementing it by giving private lessons At the same time he economized as much as he could He was paying is 6 d for his dinners, but moved to new lodgings where he could eat with a German fellowlodger for is He walked with armfuls of books and papers from the libiary in Leadenhall Street to wherever his rooms were Sometimes he was even roughly treated He had taken his broken spectacles to be repaired at a shop in the Strand, and when he went to fetch them he laid down a soveieign The salesman gave him change for only half a sovereign, and when Max Muller pointed out the mistake he became abusive to the foreigner in a well-worn coat Sadly he left the shop, aware that the ten shillings represented several dinners, 



[[56]]

and actually some days passed dinnerless One evening, however, as Muller was passing the shop the man rushed out, saying ‘Oh, sir, I have watched for you several days You were right, I found that I had ten shillings too much when I counted up my money that evening, and I have longed to get it back to you,’ and then he added, Tor you look as if you wanted it ’ 

His long-term worries were more harrowing He found that there was so much material in London and so much work needing to be done on it, that unless he was to lose the benefit of all that he had already done he must stay there for years As he wrote to Burnouf 

The MSS are splendid, but in such masses that to copy all that concerns the Veda and my work would take at least two or three years of merely mechanical labour So I must stay in England I shall do this if I can possibly, by private lessons and copying MSS, make enough to face the great expense of life here I do not deny that it is perhaps foolish to make such a sacrifice, and lead this anxious life for another five years without doing anything that can secure a settled post, but as I have once begun the work it must be finished, and I see no other way of doing it 

Burnouf replied to say that his plans were excellent, and hoped that Wilson would do something ‘Mr Wilson/ he wrote, ‘will indirectly render a great service to Indian letters if, with the benevolent liberality with which he meets all those who ask his support, he makes it possible for you to stay in London as long as the task of publishing your Rig-Veda with its commentaries and indispensable indices may require \* To his mother Muller gave an estimate of five years, and said that his work was full of interest, and kept him straight, but he also added ‘Yet sometimes one longs for more in life than this everlasting struggle ’ 

Wilson was always sympathetic and willing to help, but for the present he could not help practically That help came from another source, Baron C K J von Bunsen, Prussian Minister in London He was one of the most remarkable men of his age, a scholar who thought of himself as a student, a seeker of the origins of religion and spirituality, a man of bold and original ideas which were considered unorthodox, and possessing a waimth of heart not usual in the intellectual type Yet he was a diplomat and a man of the world, with such social talents that the whole elite of London cultivated him 



[[57]]

He had formed the idea of writing a history of spirituality when he was only twenty-five, and had actually planned to go to India to find the Veda which was believed to embody the earliest spiritual expression of man But while waiting in Rome on his way to the East, he became a friend of the Piussian Crown Prince, the future King Frederick William IV, and eventually joined the diplomatic service of his country But though he gave up the idea of studying the Veda, he never lost his scholarly and philosophical interests He worked hard at his books, and published the first of his many large works on religion and philosophy, Christianity and Mankind, in 1854 On the strength of recommendations from Humboldt and Baroness Stolzenberg he had in 1844 secured for Max Muller the offer of a tutorship, which Muller had rejected But the two had never met Now they did, about three weeks after Muller’s arrival in London, when he called on Bunsen at 4 Carlton Terrace At that time, Bunsen was fifty-five and Muller still not twenty-three Muller was astonished by the warmth of his reception This meeting was a turning-point in his career, and to the end of his life Muller felt that he could never adequately express what he owed to Bunsen Bunsen told him how glad he was to see the son of his old friend, and advised him to continue his researches without giving thought to anything else When Muller told him about his work and his financial difficulties, Bunsen at once assured him that he had found a friend (meaning himself) who would care for him as a father for a son And he kept his word He asked Muller to trust him absolutely, for he was going to take all responsibility on himself For nearly a year Muller was supported by his patron, and without that help he would have had to abandon his researches and go back to Germany What attracted Bunsen to Muller was in the first instance the Veda, whose quest he had to renounce Thus whenever he was shown some portion of Muller’s work, he said T am glad to have lived to see the Veda Whatever you want, let me know. I look upon you as myself grown young again ’ 

But if Bunsen himself was attracted by what he knew of Muller’s mind, the ladies of the family felt the attraction of his presence Mme Bunsen cherished the remembrance of his first appearance at her house for, as she wrote, he astonished the family by his youthful looks and cheerfulness 

Though Muller did not live in Carlton Terrace, he made it his real home in London, and came and went whenever he pleased Often, 



[[58]]

even during receptions, Bunsen would sit with him in the library discussing all sorts of subjects with him They did not always agree During his stay in Rome Bunsen had become acquainted with Champollion, the decipherer of hieroglyphics, and had shifted his interest to Egyptology As a result, he inclined to give primacy to Egypt and not to India in respect of the first emergence of thought and civilization Max Muller did not deny that Egypt had older historical records, but he said that his interest lay in thought Bunsen at times got very excited, for in argument he could be very violent, but that never made any difference to his affection for Muller, who was invited to all parties and special occasions besides being taken to Bunsen’s country-house at Totteridge 

Everybody who was anybody in London came to Bunsen’s house, and there Max Muller saw such personalities as the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, also divines, intellectuals and scholars in many fields of knowledge Connop Thirwal, F D Maurice, Rawhnson, Layard, Hodgson and Birch The discussions mostly took place at breakfast parties, which were in fashion then in London as they remained for many more decades at Oxford They were quite new to Muller and he enjoyed them very much, though he thought that they broke too much into the day Some of Bunsen’s parties were very grand affairs, and some idea of them can be formed from a description that Muller gave to his mother three years later 

They had asked 750 people — the whole Corps Diplomatique and the elite of English society The whole house was like a garden, the balconies covered with awnmgs from which one had a splendid view over London, the garden of the house illuminated, beautiful music, German songs with a full chorus, from the German opera now in London I cannot describe the diamonds and dresses, but I have never seen such a crowd of beautiful women and girls together Guizot was there, and Palmerston, in fact, all the lions and lionesses of the season. 

The normal parties were, however, much more intimate, and Muller liked the whole family Besides having Muller in his own house, Bunsen also took him to his friends, both in the country and in London One day he took him to the house of his friend, Archdeacon Hare at Hurstmonceaux Another time he was taken to Lord Ellesmere’s house, famous for its priceless collections of books and pictures. He wrote to his mother: 'Only think of looking round 



[[59]]

in the middle of a conversation and seeing on all sides Raphaels, Titians, Murillos, Carlo Dolcis — all originals He added a comment which makes me feel that things have changed since his days ‘This sort of thing only exists in England 9 

At first this kind of life was a great trial for Muller, for he committed any number of gaucheries from his ignorance He did not know, as he wrote in his autobiography, that potatoes could not be eaten with a fork, nor fish touched with the table-knife (for fishknives did not exist then), and he could not understand why it was worse manners to divide crisp pastry with a knife than with a fork scattering it over the table-cloth He also had difficulties in addressing and writing to people Once, having been told to address a person exactly as he was addressed by him, he wrote a letter to the Bishop of Oxford, Bishop Wilberforce, with the superscription, ‘My dear Sir, 9 because the Bishop had written to him in that way Bunsen remonstrated with him for not returning calls nor leaving cards after dining with people Yet Bunsen took delight in inviting Muller whenever he had a prince or some such grandee to lunch or dinner 

These were kindnesses meant to lick the German bear cub into shape, and Bunsen showed no less kindness when he found that Muller could not go to see his mother in Germany when she was seriously ill He at once sent him to Berlin with despatches, and this also gave him an opportunity to meet his German friends and patrons After he returned from Berlin, Bunsen helped Muller in another way which relieved him of all anxiety and dependence in regard to money, and put his plan to publish the RigVeda on a sound financial basis 

Max Muller had begun to copy and collate the mss of the RtgVeda with a view to printing it eventually, but he worked in complete uncertainty, because he did not know who might be willing to publish it He sounded out the Prussian government for financial support, but without success In Pans, too, he had no luck An offer came from the Academy of St Petersburg, but on such conditions that he could not accept it At last a German publisher of Konigsberg came forward, but he would undertake the actual work only if a sufficient number of copies were subscribed for beforehand By way of publicity Muller had a prospectus printed in a number of languages The Prussian and the French governments agreed to take a large number of sets, but the subscription was still short, and the East India Company was approached with a request to take one 



[[60]]

hundred sets At the suggestion of both Bunsen and Wilson, Muller called on the Directors, but they were unwilling to give financial support to a work carried out in a foreign country Then Bunsen, who had influence with the Directors, stepped in energetically It was no easy task to persuade the Board of Directors, all practical businessmen, to authorize considerable expenditure on an old book which none of them could read and many had not even heard of But Bunsen saw the Chairman as well as the Directors, and represented to them what a disgrace it would be if some other country than England published this sacred book of the Hindus Professor Wilson too threw in his weight At their insistence, the Directors agreed to the project in principle 

But the working out and consideration of the details took time, for the commitment was not only to be large but also uncertain During this period Muller was very restless and uncomfortable, and thought that the uncertainty was making him unfit to do any work As he wrote to his mother 'The whole month has gone in hopes, expectations, disappointments, and rejoicings, and though it is possible that I might hear today that all is settled, it may dawdle on to next year, and even fail entirely \* But he had confidence in Bunsen It did dawdle on, to the April of 1847, but on April 15 he informed his mother joyfully that the matter was decided He could hardly believe that the struggle was ending and the independence he had hoped for had at last come He was to get .£4 for every sheet printed, which, according to the programme of editing and printing Muller had worked out would give him £200 a year, which would enable him to live at ease, and the income was guaranteed for the duration of the whole work, which might be many years As it happened, there came to him at the same time an offer of a post as assistant librarian in the British Museum at .£150 a year But on Bunsen’s advice he declined it, preferring his freedom and trusting to time to bring him some means of livelihood which would be permanent. Among all his feelings the gratitude he felt towards Bunsen was the strongest. He wrote to his mother. 

I knew that none of my relations and friends agreed with me, on the contrary, that they all thought my plans foolish and exaggerated, and I had no one from whom I could expect support — I mean, who would have lent me a small sum for a few years In fact, all my time, money, and work, indeed my whole life perhaps would have been sacrificed and lost, had not Bunsen, who had once been in the same position, 



[[61]]

without my saying anything to him, stood by me, and in this way made it possible for me to struggle on with joyful confidence and firm faith towards the goal I had set before me I do not know whether I should thank God more that I have at last attained my long-desired and long-sought object or that I have gained the friendship of so noble and distinguished a man as Bunsen 

The work of printing began at once at Oxford, though he sent the text and corrected the proofs from London But in February 1847, before the question of printing had been decided, Max Muller had to come to Oxford to consult a manuscript in the Bodleian, and that was his first visit to the place where the following year he was to settle and spend the rest of his life He was enchanted by what he saw, and informed his mother ‘I have seen the most interesting and beautiful city in Europe The whole town is of the Middle Ages, and consists almost entirely of churches, monasteries (now colleges), castles, and towers, all in old English or Gothic, and the whole life is of the Middle Ages \* What struck him no less strongly was the contrast presented by the students and teachers going about in their black gowns, to what he had seen in German university towns like Leipzig or Jena where the students walked about in the streets in pink cotton trousers and dressing-gowns 

He came to Oxford four months later to pay a more formal visit, to read a paper before the seventeenth meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science held in 1847 One day, when he had gone to see Bunsen with some of his work, Bunsen said ‘You must come with me to Oxford to the meeting of the British Association 5 Muller asked him what this was, and Bunsen replied that he would explain it later, but Muller was to sit down at once and write a paper He himself was going to read a paper on the ‘Results of the recent Egyptian Researches in reference to Asiatic and African Ethnology and Classification of Languages’, and he wanted Dr Karl Meyer to support him with one on Celtic philology, and Muller with another on the relationship between the Aryan and aboriginal languages of India Muller was thoroughly frightened, but Bunsen would not take a refusal, and said ‘We must show them what we have done in Germany for the history and philosophy of language, and I reckon on your help ’ But also he was anxious to advance Muller’s career, and wanted to introduce him not only to the world of learning, but to all important people who might be able to help him 



[[62]]

Muller prepared the paper, but remained nervous, for he knew that, generally speaking, English scholars were hostile to German scholarship. More especially, he was afraid of some not very friendly ethnologists like Dr Latham and Mr Crawford, the latter well known in British learned circles as the Objector General As he expected, he was criticized when in his paper he tried to prove the Indo-European and Sanskntic affiliations of the Bengali language, which were being denied by a school of English philologists But the opposition was not so much against him or his views, as against what a group of English scholars called the ‘German clique’ headed by Prince Albert and Bunsen , and the Prince too was present at the congress However, Dr Pritchard, the pioneer British anthropologist, defended him very generously Later, there was even objection to including Muller’s paper in the proceedings, but Bunsen declared that he would not allow his own paper to be printed unless Muller’s was also, so it was Max Muller never reprinted the paper because he thought it was very immature But I found it extremely interesting as the first formulation of his linguistic ideas I have also been surprised by the knowledge he showed of the Bengali language, which he had learned in Berlin and then practised with Dwarkanath Tagore in Pans 

Though this was his first participation in a learned conference, Max Muller was not very much impressed by the discussions, the wranghngs of scholars as he called them, but he found the social occasions connected with the conference very interesting Being with Bunsen, he was invited to all the official dinners, at which the grave Vice-Chancellor, Dr Frederick Plumptree, presided At one of these Prince Lucien Bonaparte delivered a eulogy of British freedom ‘In France’, he declared, ‘with all the declamations about Liberte, Egahte, Fraternite, there is very little freedom, but you in England, you have your old tree of liberty, which is always flowering and showering peas on the whole world ’ A titter went round the table, stopping only at the Vice-Chancellor 

Max Muller went back to London to resume his work on the Rig-Veda But in order to establish a text he had to go to Pans early next year He also wanted to consult a particular manuscript in the Bibhoth&que Nationale, and to see Hagedorn. But he was caught in the February Revolution From the windows of Hagedorn’s apartment he saw the fighting and the tumult, and gave an account of his experience to his mother 



[[63]]

I am still so excited that I can hardly describe all that I have seen and done Since Tuesday last [Feb 24] I have had sleepless nights from fighting, the roar of cannon, burning of houses, fall of buildings, etc , men murdered by hundreds or simply shot down in the streets No one’s life was safe, for there was neither Government, police, nor soldiers The man in the blouse was lord of all, and blood ran in the streets, which were filled with barricades Women on horseback, ruffians on the finest officers’ chargers paraded the streets, carrying LouisPhilippe’s throne in triumph One could see all that went on from Hagedorn’s windows, the bullets whistled on every side, and yet ladies went out on foot pour voir la Revolution We did the same, and were more than once pursued by the cavalry I saw barricades built up of omnibuses, tables and pianos, attacked and taken, and again built up, till at last the soldiers fraternized with the people, gave up their weapons, and finally withdrew There was nothing grand in it 

When too many bullets began to come through his windows, Max Muller thought it prudent to leave Pans Rut the problem was to take back his trunk full of precious manuscripts, all belonging to the East India Company, for though the railway line to Le Havre was open, the station had been burnt down, and in order to get to the trams he would have to climb over three barricades He offered his concierge five francs to carry the box, but the consierge’s wife would not hear of it He raised it to ten francs, with the same result But when he held up a louts d 3 or she said to her husband ‘ Allez y mon ami , allez toujours 3 

As soon as he arrived in London he went to see Bunsen, and Bunsen took him at once to Palmerston, to whom Muller gave the first news of the deposition of Louis-Phihppe, and he also showed him a bullet which he had picked up in his own room After that he went on with his work, but found that the work of reading the proofs from London was slow as well as tiring So he decided to migrate to Oxford Another reason which inclined him to do so was that he thought he was getting too gay in London In addition to Bunsen’s parties he had his own social engagements For instance, he went regularly to the suppers given by his friend Vaux of the British Museum, whose invitation cards were adorned with pictures of Assyrian bulls and hawk-headed Egyptian gods, and he also went to balls at the houses of his English friends, and danced away in his old coat, finding the English girls to be very beautiful and pleasant 

He wrote to his mother that 'one hardly sees a single ugly face in a 3\* 



[[64]]

ballroom — which one cannot say in either France or Germany’ Then he had his German circle, consisting of German Sanskrit scholars as well as the German merchants at Denmark Hill All this came in the way of his work So in May 1848, he went to Oxford, and took rooms in Walton Street As it happened, this turned out to be the beginning of a lifelong stay 

But even at Oxford Max Muller was not to live the life of a recluse His paper had been printed along with Bunsen’s by that time, and in academic circles he found it to be ‘a good visiting card’, as he told his mother His handsome looks, extremely youthful appearance, the unfamiliar subject with which he was occupied and the kind words spoken about him by Bunsen and Dr Pritchard were remembered, and he was received very kindly by the heads of colleges, the younger teachers and the undergraduates But on account of his age, and in spite of his scholarship, he moved most naturally and happily among the younger fellows and undergraduates A majority of them were Balliol men, which meant the most brilliant young men at Oxford in those days Moner, Grant, Sellar, Palgrave, Spottiswoode, Walrond, Earle, Church, Butler, Thomson, Story-Maskelyne, all to rise to one kind of distinction or another, were among his intimates He also knew Matthew Arnold, Clough, Jowett, Stanley, Froude, Coxe, Johnson, Acland, Donkin and many others They were a happy company, and recalling them Max Muller wrote at the very end of his life ‘Those early Oxford days were bright for me, and now, when those young and old faces, whether undergraduates or archbishops, rise up again before me, I being almost the only one left of that happy company, I ask again, ‘Did they also belong to a mere dreamland, they who gave life to my hfe, and made England my real home ?\* 

He was noticed by the town, as well as the gown, as a rare and exotic bird in the streets As he passed among them he observed people staring at him and whispering to one another A vague notion had got about that the handsome young German had discovered a strange religion older than the Jewish or Christian, which also contained the key to many religious mysteries. That should speak to us in favour of the ‘man in the street’ of those days His settling at Oxford is the point at which it is necessary to take an observation, to use a nautical expression, in order to determine Max Miller’s position in his voyage through life. He was under twenty-five, yet he had completed the transition from the Run- 



[[65]]

taman principality ruled by Duke Leopold to England under the young Queen Victoria, to the Oxford of Jowett and Mark Pattison soon to be remodelled by Gladstone It was a remarkable feat for a man so young, so poor and so obscure, and the passage was no less long in terms of cultural distances than it was in space In AnhaltDessau he was in the Age of Enlightenment and Benevolent Despotism, in England people were exulting over the march of industry, science and democracy He had also reached the place where he was to spend the rest of his life, and had at last ensured a means of living which would free him from literally praying for his daily bread 

But still he had not arrived at certainty or security He did not know how long he would remain at Oxford or in England, and he was not settled in a career which he could look upon as permanent The last billet was yet to be found Whatever he had obtained was promise, not fulfilment But that was the most significant feature of his early life and choices — his regular preference for freedom to pursue what he felt as his vocation, at the expense of security and ease He never played for safety, and paid no heed to the dictum that a bird in hand is worth two in the bush This sort of behaviour which worldly wisdom regards as perversity is not found in anybody who does not possess or, to be more correct, is not possessed by a very strong sense of vocation But this sense is not a rational driving force, it is always a supra-rational motive power, almost as compulsive as submitting to love for a woman without knowing why 

But the strength with which such a sense of vocation can take hold of a man is wholly determined by his character and temperament, which make him attack the eternal problems set by life in his particular way Nothing is more profoundly true than the saying that it avails nothing if you gam the world and lose your soul But it is also terrifyingly true that the first problem for a man is to remain alive in the world before he can even dieam of conquering it So livelihood and vocation are always at loggerheads In this situation most men concentrate on livelihood, raising it if they can to security and comfort, or finally to affluence and luxury\* A minority, however, stick to vocation The former make their work conform to their means of livelihood, the latter contrive to gam livelihood out of their vocation. Certainly, it is the most difficult thing in life to make vocation and profession merge Max Muller had arrived at the starting-point of that process without achieving finality 



[[66]]

It must however be pointed out that even this beginning would not have been possible solely through his own determination and effort, unless there was something in the spirit of the age that could help him At extremely critical points of his life he had received help which came to him as if by complete chance, and he had also received general aid and encouragement which he could not have reckoned on One has to admit that a young man in Muller’s position would never have got all this in our age Quite apart from ministers, politicians, eminent divines and men of letters, would a university don of today receive a penniless beggar such as Muller appeared in the eyes of the world ? Would any head of a college at Oxford invite to his house a young and unknown foreign scholar working in the Bodleian ? The truth of the matter is that in our age, m spite of all its talk about equality of opportunity and the iniquity of class distinctions, successful and established men are infinitely more exclusive, set-conscious, stand-offish and snobbish than men in their position were in any aristocratic age Our age has erected such psychological barriers between men of different positions that the outcome has been the creation of a rancorous hatred by the have-nots for what they call the ‘Establishment’, which is mistakenly taken for a revolutionary movement Our times have recovered the primitive’s hostility for the ‘unlike’ Today an exceptional man is swamped by sheer numbers The aristocratic age recognized classes, but never made them over-rigid Its elite needed new blood continuously, and so just as it maintained its economic prosperity by marrying into wealthy bourgeois families, it welcomed talent to maintain its mental level 

There is always something mysterious about the rise of a man to fame and spectacular worldly success It presents such a complex interaction of circumstances and genius that it cannot be fully explained At the beginning nothing is seen nor even suspected. The ladder is hidden, but suddenly the heights reached are perceived, and then the whole process appears to be the result of something like determinism When one considers how and where Max Muller began and where he finally arrived, his success and fame too would seem to have been due to predestination. After he became famous, young and struggling men wrote wanting to know how he had managed to keep his head above water and yet rise in life without sacrificing his independence or his vocation He gave a modest answer to this question in his autobiography, in which he said 



[[67]]

‘Everything in my career came about most naturally, not by my own effort, but owing to those circumstances or to that environment of which we have heard so much of late/ That appears to be the theory of natural selection applied to personal success 

Max Muller had a clear idea of how this principle worked in England, and he could see the illustration of the process in the lives of many of his friends and acquaintances who rose to eminence in different lines More especially, he gave his explanation in regard to the fame and standing of Charles Kingsley, about whom he said that whenever a social or a religious or a great political question stirred the people, they thought of Kingsley Nothing in Kingsley’s worldly position could have given him this influence, but only the view generally held of the quality of his mind and character 

Now, Max Muller attributed the creation of such a view to a ‘very minute organization of public feeling in England’, of which, he added, people abroad had no idea Then he described the basis of this organization 

This close intellectual organization is favoured in England by many circumstances The number of public schools is limited Of the universities there are, or there were till lately, two only Most men of note are acquainted with each other from school or from university, and whoever has gamed the trust and love of his friends at Eton or Oxford, retains it mostly through life Add to this the innumerable societies, clubs, charitable institutions, political associations, and last, not least, the central hearth in London, Parliament, where everybody appears from time to time, if only to have a warm shaking of hands with old friends and acquaintances, and you will understand that England hangs more closely together and knows itself better than any other country in Europe As a natural result of all this there is a very sharp control A man who has once attracted public attention is not easily lost sight of 

This is a very perceptive account of the social and psychological process in nineteenth-century England which promoted men of talent from private to public status and function, and it certainly leads to the conclusion that a social and intellectual elite can do much more to utilize the available talent among a people than an egalitarian community 

Anyway, through his life at Oxford Max Muller had come into close contact with many Englishmen who belonged to this dlite 



[[68]]

working as a clearing house of ability Besides, he had also secured the good opinion of men in his line who counted, in Berlin, Pans and London In his personal affiliations he was well placed, and it now depended only on him as to how high he would rise
