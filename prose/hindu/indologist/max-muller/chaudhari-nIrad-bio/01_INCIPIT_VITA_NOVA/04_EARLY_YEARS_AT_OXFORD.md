EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 

Max Muller came to Oxford in 1848, just in time to see the last years of the old, Laudian, Tory university, in which the part that was formally the university was a pool and almost unwanted relation of the colleges The year 1854, which saw the Oxford University Act become law on August 7, was as great a landmark in the academic history of Oxford as 1832 (the year of the first Reform Act) was in the political history of the British people Old Oxford did not disappear at once, but a process of transformation was set in motion, to continue for at least three decades until a new Oxford took a stable form 

The first two of the six pre-reform years which Max Muller spent at Oxford were an interlude of peace for the old order The academic community had recovered from the stir and strife caused by the Tractanan Movement, and though its ideas were to be absorbed by the Anglican Church both in spirit and form, for the present they were discredited by Newman’s going over to Rome in 1845 Some Oxford men still adhered to these ideas, but they talked about them in private. Muller, whose early friends belonged to the proTractarian, as well as to the moie emancipated anti-Tractarian side, could hardly perceive the opposition between them until initiated by Froude and Jowett, and even they spoke with great reticence 

So, in coming to settle at Oxford in 1848, Muller could say in the words of Pope 

To happy convents, bosom’d deep in vines, 

Where slumber abbots purple as their wines 

The university was still a club — a religious, scholarly and epicurean club for its teaching members , a recreational, sporting and talking club for its student members , and a social club for both It could serve as such because as a federation of colleges it was one of the greatest landowners of England, and supported its teachers on the income accruing from landed property The students too were overwhelmingly supported by their fathers from the same kind of income, either secular or clerical

Certainly Oxford also served the cause of education In any case, the education of the dominant minority in England was the exclusive function of the two universities It put the youth of that minority through the mental disciplines considered necessary for them, to profit or not to profit by them as they pleased It also formed the manners of the young men, without as yet shaping their character — which was typical of a social class brought ready-made to the university But it is quite inaccurate to say that the university created the great men of England simply because many of them passed through it Where else could the poor devils go ? In fact, Oxford did exactly for the young of the nobility, gentry and bourgeoisie of England what education in the convents did for girls belonging to the same classes in France After passing through the convents they could become saints, bluestockings, social figures, leaders of fashion, frivolous gadabouts, femmes galantes , or even demimondaines So with the English youth after passing through Oxford and Cambridge If one Earl of Pembroke was a benefactor of Oxford, another figures in Casanova’s memoirs 

When Muller went up Oxford was not a place which any great British mind had praised for about two hundred years The pronouncement of Giordano Bruno that Oxford was ‘the widow of true science’ might be passed over as the opinion of a foreigner, but one cannot dismiss Milton, Gibbon, Adam Smith, Sir William Hamilton, or for that matter Jane Austen Yet all of them speak of Oxford with either contempt or irony 

Derisive remarks, of course, are always made about persons and institutions which are too securely and solidly established The most important thing was that Oxford could take itself for granted, and it could even make others take it for granted Mud-slmgmg did no harm because the mud slipped down its granite face Oxford would take no more notice of this than its heads of colleges would mind the pranks of their undergraduates at the Commemoration or Encaenia The Monarchy, the Parliament before 1832, the Church, the aristocracy and the squirarchy all had similar status, and Oxford was only the clerical-pedagogic wing of a whole established order Max Muller soon became conscious of the educational shortcomings of Oxford He wrote to his mother that it was more a high school than a university, and within a few months he wrote to Bunsen ‘Oxford is most beautiful, but one longs for German professors, for Greek societies, and seminars ’ But at the same time his first and

strongest impulse was to admire He was overwhelmed by its grandeur, as well as the charm and sophistication of the academics As he wrote in his autobiography ‘My first years at Oxford were spent in a perfect bewilderment of joy and admiration To me it seemed a perfect paradise 9 

What he felt most grateful for was the kindness shown to him by many of the heads of colleges He was invited to their tables At that time three venerable figures represented the gerontocracy of Oxford The first of them was Dr Routh, President of Magdalen, who was ninety-three when Muller came to Oxford, and died in perfect possession of his senses in his hundredth year in 1854 In his best days he was a pillar of Anglicanism, and Newman dedicated his Via Media to him with the words ‘To in J Routh . who has been reserved to report to a forgetful generation what was the theology of their fathers 5 But in Muller’s time he was mostly seen at the window of his room in his wig and gown, and was heard only to talk of old times He spoke about Dr Johnson, whom he had actually seen, and of King Charles I as if he had A friend offered to take Max Muller to meet him, but Muller declined because he had learnt that the old man did not like to be shown as a curiosity 

After Routh came Dr Jenkyns, Master of Balhol, who began the rejuvenation of that college which Jowett was to complete The Master’s regard for his own dignity was very great Once he slipped and fell as he was returning from a walk, and two undergraduates rushed to help him up As they were laying their hands on him, he saw an in a coming and cried out ‘Stop, I see a Master of Arts coming down the street 9 Helped on to his legs by the in A , he dismissed the undergiaduates with thanks He rebuked young Jowett, whom he found standing in his dining-room in gown and cap ‘Do my eyes deceive me, or do I see a gentleman in my diningroom with gown and cap on ^ But he also had a quiet sense of humour, and would say things without moving a muscle of his face which would make others laugh 

The third patriarch was Dean Gaisford, with whom Max Muller became more intimate than with the others, because he was made an M A of Christ Church Gaisford never taught and was absorbed wholly in textual criticism, and he also held the opinion that Greek promoted emoluments The report went about that he was unreasonable in everything except philology, and versifiers mocked him when he wooed his beautiful wife But he himself said of his

successor, Dean Liddell, who had also found that Greek helped emoluments, that Liddell 'had not found love and lexicography incompatible’ He was quickly put out if he sensed disrespect towards himself, and Muller found it easy to believe the story that he had once said to an undergraduate who had come too close to him 'Get down from my hearthrug ’ 

But to Muller, a very young man, a stranger and a German, the Dean was uniformly kind While many of the heads of houses invited him to dinner by sending a card, Dean Gaisford first called on him 

One morning at about eleven o’clock when Muller had gone into his bedroom to shave and had his face half-covered with lather, his landlady rushed into the room to announce that the Dean had come to see him and was being pulled to pieces by Muller’s Scotch terrier and her puppies Muller ran out to find the dogs tearing the sleeve of the Dean’s gown and barking at him As there was no time to change, Muller received the Dean in the state he was in His guest did not mind, and listened as Muller told him what he was doing at Oxford After that the Dean inquired about an Icelandic dictionary which was being offered to the University Press 'Surely,’ the Dean said, 'it is a small barbarous island, and how can it have any literature Icelandic studies had just begun, and Muller was able to explain to him the value of the literature of Iceland The dictionary was accepted. 

At a later date, when asked whether he would put Muller’s name on the books of the house, the Dean at first hesitated, and asked him to come and see him When Muller did, he got this reply 'I have looked through the books, and I find two precedents of Germans being members of the house, one of the name of Wernerus and another of the name of Nitzschius, or some such name ’ So the Dean was very happy to admit Muller, who was afraid that, without a precedent, he might not be taken in But the Dean later told him that even if he had not found those names he would have acted as he did People were astonished when they heard of the Dean’s courtesy to Muller 

What overwhelmed Max Muller when he settled there was the magnificence of Oxford life Soon after his arrival he had his first experience of Commemoration, and he described it to his mother 

There were great festivities for the end of the term Guizot was here, 

two sons of Mettermch, Baron von Huge!, and many of the best English

families, and a crowd of such beautiful women as I have never before seen The festivities lasted from early dawn till midnight, the gardens lighted up, with music and singing, were enchanting There were good concerts, the Messiah , the Creation , in which Birch, Tadohnee, and Lablache sang , in fact it was magnificent, and champagne and hock flowed in streams 

It would seem from all this that Oxford in those days was nearer than it is today to what Matthew Arnold called the ‘Centre’ in regard to English social and cultural life, and its regular social life and entertainment impressed Muller These struck him as very sumptuous As a poor student in Germany and France he was accustomed to the Spartan diet of a German convictormm or a dinner a deux francs at the Palais Royal, and he was confounded by the plate, the furniture, the carpets, curtains and the whole style of living of the dons of Oxford when they asked him to dine with them When invited to the houses of the heads of colleges, which he appreciated as a great honour, he found the company to consist of the other heads, canons, professors, and, at times, of distinguished persons from London, and even ladies of various ages and positions As he sat among them Max Muller felt lost or, as he put it, verrathen und verkauft He might well do so, for he was unused to this kind of life, and moreover, he was only twenty-five 

He saw other young men at these parties, in evening dress and the short gown of the undergraduate They stood together on one side of the room They were invited to join the company after dinner, and received a cup of tea Beyond this they were not noticed, and they themselves called the ceremony ‘doing the perpendicular’. Max Muller’s position was different, but after the dismissal of the undergraduates at about ten o’clock he would go and join them in their rooms, and would talk or smg in a more comfortable posture ^ At one of the earliest dinners, which was informal and private, Max Muller met Thackeray A fellow of St John’s had arranged it expressly for the great man There were only four young men, all very much awed by him No one ventured to say a word, and Thackeray maintained his silence till the soup was over, though the others were expecting a brilliant sally from him every minute. At last at the commencement of the second course he looked at the fine John Dory which was waiting to be splayed on the table, turned his large spectacled eyes on Muller, and said ‘Are you going to eat your own ancestor All of them stared, and Thackeray, looking very 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 97 

grave and learned, said, ‘Surely, you are the son of the Dorian Muller — the Muller who wrote about the Dorians, and was not John Dory the ancestor of all the Dorians There was general laughter, and Muller explained that he was not the son of Otfned Muller who had written about the Dorians, but of Wilhelm Muller who had written Die Homensche Vorschule and Die Schone Mullenn Then he perpetrated a joke as far-ranging as Thackeray’s ‘How could John Dory be their ancestor, because the original John Dory was II Janitore , that is, St Peter, who had no wife or would not acknowledge her in public, though he was kind to his mother-in-law ’ This wholly thawed Thackeray, who poured out his wit and sarcasm and told anecdote after anecdote, helping himself meanwhile to plenty of vinegar and cayenne pepper 

When Max Muller mixed with the undergraduates he felt as if he was one with them, though he was already becoming recognized as a scholar He could not say which years he enjoyed more, those at Leipzig and Berlin, or those at Oxford Very early in his stay there he even thought of formally enrolling himself as an undergraduate, though he was a doctor of Leipzig University of five years’ standing He wrote to Bunsen ‘I have an idea of entering one of the colleges as an undergraduate, keeping my twelve terms, and then taking my degree.’ He also wanted to take riding lessons so as to be able to join the crowds of students whom he saw pass by in their red coats and riding hats going to the hunt He had to give up the idea as it was expensive But as to the kind of life he led, he wrote in his autobiography ‘In Paris I was already something of a scholar and writer, at Oxford I became once more an undergraduate ’ 

He also wrote that it never struck him then that these young men had within them the germs of future greatness What struck him was the general tone and level of conversation There were many with whom he lived on terms of great intimacy who afterwards became bishops, ambassadors, judges, ministers Thinking of them in later life and remembering them as young men who were not so very different from others who through life remained wholly unknown, he wondered if he had slept through a number of years and suddenly awoke to a new life Some of his early friends he found to be the same, whether in ermine or in lawn sleeves , others, however, became different — the boy in them had vamshed, and nothing was to be seen except the bishop, the judge or the minister But he was so attached to them when he first met them at Oxford that he wrote

when they began to leave Oxford ‘My early Oxford friends, with whom I felt at home, leave one after another, and it is not worth while to make new acquaintances 5 To become indifferent to new acquaintances at the age of twenty-seven showed a considerable capacity for attachment to people 

There is also no doubt that the young stranger from Germany had great attraction for the dons and undergraduates of Oxford One of his early friends there wrote about him after his death 

Max and I were nearly of the same age, and I am now seventy-eight, with a memory, alas 1 no longer quick and vivid The figure of Max is, however, never dimmed in my vision Though near my age, I never looked on him as less than ten years older than myself in wisdom, tact, experience of life, and knowledge of men ‘King’ was the term Bunsen applied to him, and though he seems from the beginning to have lived with the Olympians, whether intellectual or social, it was they who sought him rather, I think, than he who climbed into their company 

A similar testimony comes from Canon Farrar, who wrote to Mrs Max Muller after his death about the occasion when he first met Muller 

I was dining with Jowett, and Max Muller with Walrond Though the talk during dinner was not strictly literary, some point of literature turned up, and Muller’s opinion on it was asked by Walrond Instantly, there was silence among the twenty men at table All listened to the stripling as he appeared Stanley who was sitting next to me, and who had been discussing the memoirs of Stirling, stopped and listened attentively Muller replied to the question with great modesty, though with self-possession, and with a brevity which allowed the conversation to flow back soon to its previous course I instantly asked Jowett who he was, and learned that he was a young German of great promise who had been at Oxford for about two years and was engaged in editing the oldest Sanskrit literature I name this as a sign of the profound respect which at so early a period was shown to him in an 61ite society like that of Balliol 

But it was not solely his learning that attracted people to him He had considerable social talent, and was a witty speaker and conversationalist Unfortunately, no record of this survives All the formal books by him are serious and solemn\* because he did not like persiflage or even wit in serious discussion. He once said: ‘People

99 


do not know what a dangerous game this French persiflage is, particularly in England, and how difficult it becomes to exchange it afterwards for real seriousness ’ That prevented him from showing his humorous side in his writings So there are only testimonies to his wit and humour, and virtually no examples 

Rut his greatest social qualification at Oxford in his early days was that he was musical, and a very fine player and singer himself In those days he had the entree to many Oxford drawing-rooms as a pianist, and chatter ceased at his brilliant touch People who knew nothing about the Rig-Veda knew him as a pianist In those days music was just beginning to be a part of Oxford life No don dared play an instrument, and an undergraduate still less The utmost length that the latter would go to would be to sing a song Yet there was love of music, though hardly any execution So Max Muller was much in demand There was only one other person in Oxford’s academic society who could play really well, and that was Professor Donkin As he was an invalid and was always regarded as dying nobody minded his playing So he and Muller were expected to make music at parties 

Muller hired a piano to keep up his practice, gave it up for want of time, and then had to hire one again because all his friends wanted him to play. In 1851 he actually bought an instrument, a grand square Collard, and through a friend got it for only £50 It was so large that it could not be carried up the stairs of his lodgings but had to be hoisted through a window When his friend Victor Cams came to stay at Oxford for a shoit time Max Muller and he would play violin and piano sonatas and keep hearers spellbound, for under Muller’s hands the sounds of the piano, as one of them said, became a poem in music 

So Muller’s popularity grew But there may have been another less consciously perceived factor which made for his popularity among the liberals of Oxford with whom he mostly associated This was the fact of his being a German Germans were not liked by the conservative Anglican churchmen, and were positively disliked by the High Church school created by the Oxford Movement whose leader, Newman, thought that Lutheranism and Calvinism were heresies. 

But it was quite the opposite in liberal circles For about a decade by the middle of the nineteenth century, Germanizing had become not only an intellectual trend but almost a fashion at Oxford All

the advocates of reform and of liberalism in theology and philosophy were called Germamzers by their opponents, and in a sense they were Jowett, for instance, went to Germany, became familiar with Hegel’s writings which were unknown at the time at Oxford, and came back determined to conquer this new world of thought He became the pioneer in the naturalization of Hegel’s thought which became the source of English philosophical speculation at the end of the nineteenth century 

The first step towards this end was a thorough mastery of the German language, which was rare in England at the time But the trend grew, and in Balliol it became almost an affectation to employ German for saying things which could equally well be said in English Max Muller’s future wife acquired real proficiency in the language at this time Even Pusey went to Germany in order to become familiar with the latest scholarship in theology and biblical studies, though only to become deeply distrustful of it Among Muller’s friends, Froude and Palgrave knew the language well In 1849 he wrote to Palgrave that he wished he could read Goethe with him, and he added Tor my own sake, not for yours, for you are not the man to misunderstand him ’ This was a very handsome compliment to Palgrave’s knowledge of German 

Palgrave was one of Muller’s earliest friends at Oxford, and was of special help to him in guiding him in writing English His English compositions were always revised by Palgrave in the kindest possible manner, and it was this help which enabled Muller to write the language so well and to use it for all his major works When he left Oxford tojom the Education Department in London, Muller missed him very much None the less, he gave him news of Oxford\* 

Oxford is flourishing again Stanley, Jowett, etc , are up Old Froude, however, has left a blank, and if you saw how they have pulled down your house, and how the fireplace where we smoked so many a jolly cigar is exposed to the eyes of the vulgas profanum , you would find it a subject not unworthy of an elegy Bye-bye, old fellow Don’t forget Oxford and the old set, who send you their love 

Another still more famous figure was one of Muller’s early Oxford friends That was Matthew Arnold. He admned Arnold to the end of his life, and wrote in his reminiscences that he was beautiful, strong and manly as a young man, and yet full of dreams and schemes Muller found it strange that nobody suspected his genius at the 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 101 

time, and also that he never rose higher than an Inspector of Schools while many of his contemporaries became great political or ecclesiastical figures Arnold, however, never gave any thought to this He never asked for anything, but Max Muller thought that his friends should have done something for him to show that he had not been left behind in the worldly race Later in life, he wrote to influential friends urging public recognition for Arnold 

Some verses written by Palgrave in 1851 show at its best and most touching the spirit of the friendship which sprang up between a foreigner and some of the most brilliant English young men of the day. Here are the lines 

An English welcome to an English shore 

Such as we could, some four years since we gave thee. 

Not knowing what the Fates reserved in store Or that our land among our sons would have thee, 

But now thou art endenizen’d awhile 

Almost we fear our welcome to renew 

Lest what we seemed to promise, should beguile, 

When all we are is open to thy view But yet if aught of what we fondly boast — 

True-hearted warmth of Friendship, frank and free, 

Survive yet in this island-circling coast, 

We need not fear again to welcome thee — 

So may we, blessing thee, ourselves be blest, 

And prove not all unworthy of our guest. 

If the experiences described so far were making Muller’s life happy in England, there were other things which he could not understand The first thing which surprised Muller at Oxford was the absence of duels, whose prevalence in the German universities he had defended At Oxford a man either apologized, or proved himself a cad and was immediately dropped 

Another thing which almost shocked Muller was the disrespect of the students towards their teachers In the German universities the students almost worshipped their professors, and never questioned their ipse dixit At Oxford Max Muller found that it was the common amusement of the undergraduates to make fun even of the heads of houses, and the doctors of divinity in their red gowns and black velvet sleeves were objects of the most outspoken disrespect. The looseness of undergraduate tongues at the Encaenia he accepted

as the Saturnalia of their university life, and he could even enjoy some of the remarks he heard at the beginning His first experience of this was when Dr F Plumptree, as Vice-Chancellor, stood up to address the audience in the Sheldoman His first words were not quite distinct, and the undergraduates shouted ‘Speak up, Old Stick 5 Dr Plumptree was very tall and stately 

Max Muller himself was subject to some good-natured leg-pulling too on account of his ignorance He had noticed the letters fp on boards at a height of about ten feet at many places in the streets They stood for ‘Fire Plug’ But when he inquired, his friends told him that they indicated the height of the very tall Dr Frederick Plumptree 

He also found the constitution of the university very puzzling In Germany no university could do without a Minister of Education to appoint professors, or without a Royal Commissioner to look after the undergraduates and their moral and political sentiments At Oxford he was told that the only ruling power consisted in the Statutes of the University Professors and tutors were free so long as they conformed to these Statutes ‘If we want a thing done/ his friends told him, ‘we do it ourselves, as long as it does not run counter to the Statutes ’ 

Then the practise and profession of religion at Oxford baffled Muller When he came to Oxford he was strongly recommended to Dean Stanley on the one hand, and to Manuel Johnson the Observer (the University Astronomer) on the other Johnson was in the High Church Movement, and in his house Muller met all its leaders Stanley was a liberal, and received him very kindly as the friend of Bunsen, F D Maurice and Hare. At first Muller could not understand that he was dealing with two camps At Johnson’s as well as at other places he heard a kind of discussion he could not connect with the true religious spirit. He was puzzled to see men whose learning and character he sincerely admired, absorbed in subjects which, to his mind, seemed merely childish He expected he would hear from them some new views on the date of the gospels, the meaning of revelation, the historical value of revelation, or the early history of the Church But of all this he heard not a word Nothing but discussions on the validity of the Anglican orders, on vestments, genuflexion and candles, on the altar being made of wood or stone, of consecrated wine being mixed with water, of the pnest turning his back on the congregation, etc. Of the historical approach 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 103 

to Christianity with which he had become familiar in his country, there was no trace In his bewilderment, he asked both Johnson and Stanley what all these things had to do with true religion, but was advised by them to keep aloof and say nothing 

Though Muller’s simple Lutheran faith was bound to make him unsympathetic to ritualism, he could see where the desire for an elaborate ritual came from His friend Johnson constantly complained about the monotonous and mechanical performances of the Anglican clergy He had a strong feeling for all that was beautiful and impressive in art, and he wanted, as Muller perfectly understood, to see the service of God in church to be full of both reverence and beauty 

Max Muller also felt that Newmamsm was a natural trend in the English Church, and he expressed the opinion to Bunsen that he was convinced that a regeneration of the English Church could only come from the High Church party Even though inclining to Romanism, Muller felt that Newmamsm could bring the English Church to a state of ferment out of which it was likely to emerge purified and reformed What he saw of the practices and spirit of the official Anglican Church at Oxford was bound to confirm him in this view It was lifeless 

But the ecclesiastical establishment, inert and somnolent as it was m many matters, could be extremely awake in detecting heresy and equally active in suppressing it One of Muller’s early and intimate friends at Oxford suffered from this He was James Anthony Froude, the future historian, and at that time a fellow of Exeter College He published his Nemesis of Faith, early in 1849, an d at once there was a doctrinal stoim The scandal was such that Froude had to give up his fellowship, and lose his only means of livelihood This was not, however, the worst of his punishments His father, a well-to-do and well-known archdeacon, was so displeased that he stopped the allowance he was making to his son. Even when he secured the headmastership of a college in distant Tasmania, his enemies got the appointment cancelled Froude, who was engaged to be married, was in great distress, and had to sell his books one by one At that time a cheque from an undisclosed source came to Max Muller to be handed to him Many years later Froude discovered the name of the donor, and returned the money which had saved him from insolvency. 

Muller tiled to help his friend by bringing him in contact with

Bunsen, who at once invited him to his house Muller thought that it would be sad if a man of Fronde’s talents was to fall into the hands of the English Radicals, Chartists and Unitarians, and he thought if Bunsen could send him to Germany in some capacity he could perhaps serve religion better in his own country by transforming the results of German theological and historical investigations into a native product But this came to nothing, and Fioude had to leave Oxford Before he did so even his friends and acquaintances avoided him Many times, when walking in the streets with Muller, he would pass a former friend who took no notice of him, and say ‘That is another cut 5 

Another discovery, of quite the opposite kind, pained Muller no less He found that men who were considered quite orthodox were really without any belief They spoke freely to him because they imagined that as a German he would share their scepticism He saw that it was not simply honest doubt which was disturbing them They had passed through that phase of disbelief, and had settled down to a Voltairian levity which scoffed at everything connected with religion This was something which he never expected to find at Oxford In writing of the prevalence of this kind of irreligiosity, Max Muller naturally did not mention names, but he thought it necessary to mention the fact as a part of the mosaic of religious thought and feeling which existed at Oxford when he went there 

While observing Oxford life as well as participating in it, Max Muller was, of course, carrying on his own highly specialized work of editing the Rig-Veda It called for immense labour, but by the end of 1849 h e ^ a< i seen t ^ ie ^ rst volume through the pi ess He had the German capacity foi working on any project in hand without allowing his social life and recreations, his moods, or even his anxiety in respect of worldly prospects, to divert him from it Nevertheless, he had his worries 

He was only a sojourner at Oxford, and had no connexion with the university He did not know whether Oxford would have any permanent career to offer him, and he did not try to find any as yet. He did not know how long he would remain there, and had a vague notion that the stay would last until the whole of the Rtg»Veda was published, which might take years In fact, beyond the assurance that he was provided with an income which would enable him to live modestly as long as this commission continued and which would give him some freedom not to jump at any employment that might 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 105 

come in his way, everything about his future was undecided and unknown However, within a month of coming to Oxford he discovered that T must find some further occupation here, for Sanskrit alone does not yield enough to live on 5 As he extended his social life, he made the further discovery that to live in Oxford society was expensive The question of a permanent career had to be considered, if not decided 

All this, together with a clash in his mind between his natural love for Germany and the growing liking for England, made him oscillate between the two countries when considering his future At Oxford he was only a resident alien As he wrote to his mother ‘Life is on the whole very pleasant, and yet one feels as if one hardly belonged to it , people are too polite for one to feel quite at ease 9 He thought that if he could live at one of the universities on the Rhine, at Bonn or Heidelberg, one might enjoy life more He hoped that would come some day so that he would be able to drink a good glass of Rhine wine with his family and friends At the same time he also knew perfectly well that though his life in a foreign country often seemed tedious and made him wish to go back to his own country and people, ‘one must woik to live, and work where one finds work 5 So he wrote to his mother on October 3, 1848 ‘If I go to Germany next year, I must look about and see what can be done there, and if any prospects open for me , if not I must look out for some career that later on would settle me here 9 

What made him yearn to go back to Germany in 1848 and 1849 was the turmoil produced by the revolutions of that period ‘It sometimes seems to me wrong’, he wrote, ‘to be sitting and working here so peacefully in Oxford, whilst so many in Germany are torn away from their scientific employments and must share all the dangers of war ’ He was still more perturbed the next year when he learned about the distuibances at Dresden, and he wrote to his mother. ‘If this goes on in Germany, I cannot leave you there without protection, and I am really thinking of giving up my work here, and going to you In times like this all other considerations must give way, and many plans be given up 9 

But this compulsion did not actually face him So what he had to consider during these years was whether going to Germany would result in any good, given the kind of life he had chosen and the type of character that was his He put his case to his mother quite clearsightedly 



106 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

The revolutions in Germany have laid such hold on all circumstances of life, and have so undermined the foundations of society, that one loses all courage to build one’s future on such a soil, unless one feels the strength and power to take an active part in initiating and settling matters On the contrary, if one wishes to find one’s ideal of life in the narrow quiet circle of science, one has the right, I think, to seek shelter there where science, if not patronized and aided, is at least tolerated and left alone 

He felt that, as he was, he would in Germany only be drawn into party conflicts without the power to effect any good So he considered whether he would not do well to settle down in England entirely, and thought he might be quite at home and happy there He put his state of mind even more positively ‘With all my love of the past, and with full belief in the future of Germany, I feel more drawn at present to English than to German soil 9 But his ambivalence between the two countries was to continue for years 

The question was decided practically for him by external circumstances. He also found that he did not have full freedom to decide by himself In the middle of 1849, when the first volume of his edition of the Rtg-Veda was nearing completion, he thought that after it was published he would go back to Germany, take up any post he could find there, and continue editing and printing the work from there He thought that would offer no practical difficulty, nor delay the final publication So he put the idea to Professor Horace Hayman Wilson, who was supervising his work on behalf of the East India Company At once there was an explosion Wilson, a very self-willed and even irascible man, told him that he would never hear of it, and added sarcastically ‘It is no use talking about Vaterland and Hetmweh Why, all young men who go to India never see their fathers and mothers again My father and mother died before I came back That cannot be helped But that is your lookout You will never go to Germany with my permission \* 

The next day Wilson relented a little, and Max Muller felt encouraged to toy with the idea of being able to edit the Rig-Veda from Germany He was curiously unsettled in mind Two weeks after the conversation with Wilson he informed his mother that, since he could not hope for a speedy settling down of Germany, he was going to look for a settled position in England But in six weeks he wrote to her again that as he was to go on a holiday in Germany at the end

of the year, when the first volume of the Rig-Veda would be published, and spend the winter with her, he would try to find a place in a German university, preferably Bonn, and see if it would be possible to come over to England for a short period every year to look after the printing of the Rig-Veda The truth was that his judgement told him that he was likely to remain in England for many years, while his emotional preference was still for his own country He put that quite clearly to his mother ‘The longer one lives in England, the more one longs to be back in Germany A stormy sea is better than a dead sea! The English grow more like the Chinese with each year, and nature herself has built a Chinese wall round their lovely country But if one can make oneself into a Chinaman, one gets on well with them ’ 

But as the long holiday in Germany was months away, and Max Muller was ill and needed rest, his friend Moner carried him off to the Lake District to join one of Jowett’s reading parties and also to meet Froude who was staying there He felt well as soon as he got there, and was enchanted by the beauty of the mountains and lakes He paid unstinted tribute to it in a letter to his mother. ‘The beauty of England,’ he said, ‘is so great that one cannot understand why the English always go to the Continent in search of beautiful scenery ’ 

At the end of October he went to Berlin He paid visits to Dresden and Leipzig, and then returned to Berlin bringing his mother with him But by January he was tired of his idleness and longing to be back at Oxford He had already met his old friend, Alexander von Humboldt, and shortly before he was to leave, went to see him again Humboldt told him that King Frederick William IV had expressed a wish to see him before he left Berlin, and brought him an invitation to dinner. Muller had seen the King once and presented a copy of the first volume of the Rig-Veda to him in a private audience The King told him that he knew all about it, and had so much to say himself about the book that Muller hardly got any chance to give his own account of it 

But a strange thing happened on the morning of the dinner. Muller was sitting in his lodgings with his mother, when a young lieutenant of police entered and began an interrogation— why he had come to Berlin, what was keeping him there, and when he was to leave Muller explained that he had come to collate manuscripts m the Royal Library, but the officer informed him that the police

authorities wanted him to leave within twenty-four hours At that Muller told him quietly ‘Of course, I shall obey orders and leave at once, but I must request the police authorities to inform His Majesty the King that I shall not be able to dme with him tonight 5 When the officer saw that Muller was in earnest he looked thunderstruck and left with a bow Soon after a senior official arrived at Muller’s house to apologize 

In the afternoon Humboldt came to take him to Charlottenburg, and when told of the incident was extremely amused Afterwards Muller found out the reason for his order of expulsion In Berlin he had been seeing a fellow Sanskrit scholar, Goldstucker, almost every day, and Goldstucker had been mixed up with political activities, was kept under surveillance, and was even looked upon as a dangerous revolutionary Max Muller was taken as an emissary to him from England, then considered to be the focus of all political conspiracies 

Max Muller had arranged to leave immediately after this dinner, but his friend Morier, who was in Beilm, fell ill and he was obliged to stay on and nurse him In the meanwhile, his long absence from Oxford and his work had angered Wilson, and on February 26 he wrote a peremptory letter to Max Muller saying that unless the work proceeded faster he himself would not live to see it finished ‘But seriously, 5 Wilson added, ‘I wish you would soon resume your labours It is high time to put a stop to all the wild fancies that a partial knowledge of the light and reliance upon such equivocal guides as the Brahmanas and Sutras seem likely to engender I want you also to help in the distribution of copies 5 So Muller had to return at once, and for the next few months he devoted himself to the Veda y and even spent the long vacation at Oxford, though he wrote to Palgrave to say that it was more like purgatory than anything else ‘Yet here I am,’ he added, ‘and I cannot get away on account of one miserable ms, which I must go and look at every day while I am carrying my Rig~Veda through the pi ess 5 

From this it could be anticipated that Muller would again be seized with a fit of weariness with England and his life there, and so he was At the end of the year he thought he would write to Lassen, the great Sanskntist at Bonn, and in his desperation even contemplated that if nothing came out of Germany he would try India He wrote to Bunsen, and spoke to Wilson about his intentions Bunsen was frightened, and informed him that it was the very 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 109 

worst time to go to Bonn Wilson advised him to remain in England or go to India 

Besides his love for and loyalty to Germany, it was the dichotomy m his character, divided between will and judgement on the one hand and passion and impulse on the other, which was causing him to waver in this fashion But the immediate reason was the uncertainty of his prospects and the strain of living from hand to mouth Even in his desperation Muller could summon philosophy to his aid Tf Lassen makes difficulties,’ he wrote , 4 1 must decide to stay in England, till a kindly fate leads me out of the Oxford hermit’s cell, into free German air, or into a forest solitude in India ’ 

The fates decided for Oxford At the end of the year (1850) there came an offer from the Taylorian Institution to lecture there on modern European languages The Institution was an adjunct of the university, and it was governed by a body of curators It was also housed in a building which in its style did not conform to Oxford architecture, in fact, it was the hist Palladian building to be erected there with statues on its top It is now the eastern wing of the Ashmolean, with its fagade on St Giles. In 1848 the Institution had founded a professorship of modern European languages, to provide lectures from the point of view of comparative philology, and it appointed as its first holder a half-Russian, half-Swiss Orientalist and linguist, named Trithen, who was a friend of Muller But soon after his appointment he began to go out of his mind, and could not deliver all the lectures So Muller was asked if he would lecture in Trithen’s absence on a part of his annual salary of .£400 At first he hesitated, but afterwards accepted at Bunsen’s insistence He began his lectures from the Lent Term of 1851, and the subject of the first course was ‘The History of Modern Languages’ The prospect of succeeding to the professorship also weighed with Muller, and as Trithen was found to be hopelessly ill and had to go into an asylum, Muller was appointed Deputy Professor 

In the courses of lectures which he delivered for three years in this post, Muller developed the ideas he was to set down more fully and formally as a pioneer in linguistics But his unsettled mood continued, and he still longed to go back to Germany Tf any sort of favourable prospect offered,’ he wrote to his mother, T would willingly exchange my pleasant life in Oxford for a simple German manage,’ Again he wrote T am nowhere so happy as in Dessau You will laugh at this, but had you been living for six or seven years

among strangers you would understand how delightful it is to see well-known faces and well-known streets and houses round one If I had independent means, I would live in Dessau, and by choice in my grandfather’s house with the garden, where I know every tree \* The high grim busts of the Caesars on the railing of the Sheldoman must have smiled sardonically, for Oxford was soon to claim him permanently And when in late life he went to his birthplace he did not meet one man or woman whose face or name he knew, and he had to go to the old cemetery outside the town to be greeted by old names, some very dear to him and others forgotten in his zvanderjahre However, he went for a holiday to Germany in the summer of 1852, and travelled as far afield as the Tyrol But he returned to Oxford 

In 1853 Trithen died, and the Taylonan Professorship fell vacant Max Muller immediately applied for it He ran every chance of getting it, but the curators took a long time to decide, and again his temperament made him worry unduly He wrote to Bunsen 

It is a hard trial of one’s patience I really don’t know what to do, and whether it is not best to return to Germany and finish up and publish what I have already done on the RigVeda My friends advise me to stay on here, and they assure me Convocation would veto the election of anyone else, if the Curators attempted it For myself, I am almost indifferent I shall have another year of uncertainty, of which I have had enough in the past three years However such is the world, says John Bull, and tries to console himself I am doing my best to follow his good advice 

Bunsen gave him even more energetic admonition Tt is a great trial of patience, but be patient, that is, wise One must never allow the toilsome labour of years, of quiet reflexion, and of utmost exertion for the attainment of one’s aim to be destroyed by an unpropitious event ’ Max Muller obeyed 

But it did take nearly a year before, at the beginning of February 1854, the Professorship was at last decided in his favour. He wrote joyfully to his friend Palgrave. 

I cannot tell you how happy I feel, after the long suspense, to have at last a 7cou oto 5 for the rest of this life, and to be able to look on quietly till the moving panorama comes to an end I feel now more than ever that it is owing to the kindness of those who first received me at Oxford

that I owe my further success and present position Ce n’est que le premier pas qui coute , and after I was once in the right boat I was sure to get into harbour sooner or later 

A month later he gave the news to his mother After saying that he was tired of the endless parties that were being given him, he wrote ‘You can imagine I was not a little pleased when everything was definitely settled But when one waits so long for a thing it does not give one the same pleasure as when it comes unexpectedly But I heartily thank God that my future is now entirely secured, as far as food and raiment are concerned ’ 

Bunsen’s congratulations were wholehearted He had already told Muller that neither he himself nor Muller would ever again be quite at home in Germany, and he wrote ‘Your position in life now rests on a firm foundation . . and that in this heaven-blest, secure, free island, and at a moment when it is hard to say whether the thrones of princes or the freedom of nations is in greatest danger ’ 

This appointment was not a professorship of the university, nor was his membership of Christ Church as an honorary in a since December 1851 a formal incorporation in it But for all practical purposes he belonged to Oxford and his future was decided, though he would still think of going to Germany He was to remain in England till his death, and even before the question of his selection as Taylorian Piofessor had been decided, another event had taken place which made it impossible for him to leave England In November 1853 he had met English girl who was to be his wife With his uncertain prospects he was not thinking of marrying at all His mother often urged him, but he considered it would be madness to marry Actually, in reply to one of her letters, he had written in the middle of 1853 ‘I have not yet any plans of the sort I think one has enough trouble in making one’s way through the world If such a thing presents itself — well , but I have no wish to take much tiouble in looking about ’ However, it did present itself On November 26 of the same year he saw an English gill of nineteen, and at the age of thirty fell violently in love at first sight This was going to be as great a combined romance and trial in his life as his career had been 

James Anthony Froude had married Charlotte Grenfell, while Charles Kingsley had marned another sister, Fanny The Grenfells were originally from Buckinghamshire, and had settled around 



112 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Taplow and Maidenhead They had their money in banking and mining, and interests in sport The brother of Charlotte and Fanny was Riversdale Grenfell, whose motherless and beautiful daughter Georgina was brought up by her maiden aunt, the eldest Miss Grenfell The women of the family seem to have been different from the men, with stronger religious, intellectual and passionate inclinations Froude had often talked of his clever young German friend to his relatives, and Riversdale Grenfell asked him to bring Max Muller to his house, Ray Lodge, near Maidenhead, for a Saturday to Monday visit He came, and fascinated all present by his brilliant, lively conversation and exquisite music Georgina Grenfell has described his appearance as it was then ‘He was very dark, with regular features, fine bright eyes, and a beautiful countenance full of animation, and it was difficult to reconcile his youthful appearance with his already great reputation ’ 

On Max Muller the impression was decisive Years after he told his wife that as soon as he saw her he felt ‘That is my fate \* I have seen the journal which Georgina Grenfell kept for three years to set down her agony of mind at not being allowed by her father to marry him I read the following in his own handwriting ‘I loved you from the first day I saw you, and wherever you are my soul will always cling to yours I never loved any one, till I saw you, and I never shall love any one else ’ Underneath were pressed three pansies with some leaves, and they still retain some of their colours 

This passionate commitment at first sight is in the line of direct descent from Dante, who wrote about his first vision of Beatrice ‘At that moment, I say most truly that the spirit of life, which hath its dwelling in the secretest character of the heart, began to tremble so violently that the least pulses of my body shook therewith; and in trembling said these words Ecce deus fortior me, qui vemens domimbatur mthi [Here is a deity stronger than I, who, loving, shall rule over me] ’ 

But Dante’s poetic idealization of love needs a good deal of explanation, especially to those who have come to employ the word ‘Victorian’ as a pejorative. Even less clever people smile at the mention of love at fiist sight This is natural For one thing, neither love nor death seem quite real when they strike down otheis. And, being supra-rational, love is never wholly accessible to the intellect This makes ordinary minds admit its existence but without understanding its nature.

EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 

In an age which is weary and blase it needs a renaissance of wonder to understand love As soon as one pauses to think about it, love takes on the appearance of a mystery or even a miracle This is of course more true of love at first sight It is not created by any attraction set going by the mind Far less is it the product of sexual desire If Max Muller was transfixed by the very first sight of Georgina Grenfell, it could not have been through the rousing of such an urge Nor had he any knowledge of her mind What was it in her then that had brought this about ? 

The question really cannot be answered If Max Muller recognized his ‘fate 9 in Georgina, it was the kind of fatalism which makes a wireless set tuned to a particular wavelength receive only the messages transmitted to it through that wavelength In short, love at first sight is ineluctable and beyond reason, and it has nothing to do with the mind That also makes it very dangerous Perhaps that is why love has been called blind, which is only a crude way of saying that it is abstract and yet compulsive Max Muller found it to be so 

Two days after his visit to Ray Lodge, the Grenfells went to Oxford for a meeting of the leading church choirs of the diocese, and there he was their constant guide in sightseeing When they left they invited him to spend Christmas with them He could not go, and gave engagements with Bunsen and his own work as reasons But something else had happened in the meanwhile to make him shy Muller had not lost time, and had written to Froude about his wish to marry Georgina The latter replied on December 19, saying that he was not altogether surprised, for he had had a full account of what had taken place at Oxford He had to say something, but also felt that it was hard indeed to know what to say when the means of coming to a right judgement were so small, and a mistake could be dangerous\* 

He could not hold out any immediate hope for his friend, and felt unhappy T am writing like an icicle, 9 he said, 'as if the east wmd had got mto my mk and chilled it But what I want you to see is that they have not yet had time to form such a judgement upon you as would allow them in common prudence to give a favourable answer at present 9 As to going to Ray Lodge, his advice was wise Tf you feel, 9 he said, 'that you can control yourself I believe I may advise you to go as you will to Ray Lodge, if not, I should say certainly do not go But I do not know whether I have a right to say “go 99 under

any circumstances, and her happiness may be at stake, I do not mean now But if she sees much of you it might become so 5 The immediate obstacle, as Froude saw it, was insufficient acquaintance The girl, he said, hs only nineteen and there would be a natural desire that she should not so early in life be allowed to come to a hasty decision’ So he advised Max Muller to go on gently, to let acquaintance ripen into intimacy He spoke to his wife, and she wished that Muller would come and see her Froude strongly urged his friend to come, saying ‘It will be worth your while even for your dearest purpose, as you will be gaming acquaintance among the other members of the family 9 

But the most serious difficulty was money, without a sufficient amount of which according to his own ideas Riversdale Grenfell was never likely to give his consent to any proposal of marriage foi his daughter On this score Froude gave information about his relations which showed how much trust he had in his foreign friend Though Riversdale Grenfell lived in great comfort and was bringing up his daughter almost in luxury, Froude thought he could not leave her much money As he explained 

Riversdale married secretly, the match not being approved by his family, and therefore there was no marriage settlement no one in consequence can tell what his children’s fortunes will be He has been extravagant and is not likely to have saved, and my impression is that he has insured his life largely, but that in his life he will not be able to give very much to them You would not mind this in itself, but you are aware that it will make him feel it the more necessary that by an insurance if not by other means a provision of some sort must be made by whoever marries Georgma, though on the other hand he would probably make her a liberal allowance I speak of these things because it will be on them, if anywhere, that the difficulty will arise 

Nothing could be more realistic and frank But Froude saw the want of money only as a temporary obstacle, though Max Muller as lover was inclined to look on it as the blasting of his hopes for ever So he was reminded of his prospects, both near and distant Froude said that the Grenfells were fully sensible of the high and distinguished position which he occupied, and in actual fact his prospects were as good as any professional person could wish for. He told Muller that in January the question of his professorship was to be settled, and then the salary might be raised, and the Sanskrit professorship held by FI H Wilson might also become vacant ‘At any

rate/ Fronde observed, ‘the more they see and hear you the more good they will sec and hear the more they will be assured that even in a worldly point of view you have a clear and prosperous future before you, and I do not pietend to say that considerations of this kind will not be of weight God bless you, my dear fellow, I wish I could say more ’ 

Froude conveyed to his friend some idea of the dramatis personae who were to have a voice, direct or indirect, in this matter Of his wife, the girl’s aunt, he said that she entirely and heartily sympathized with him and wished him success She even proposed to speak to her eldest sister pnvately, so that the matter might not go any further Froude particularly asked Max Muller to take Miss Grenfell into his confidence, and assured him of her sympathy in all circumstances, though not of hei consent at this stage Muller, he said, could depend upon receiving the wisest and kindest advice from her On this point he was insistent He wrote ‘If I were you I would implicitly trust Miss Grenfell I would go to Ray Lodge, see her, talk to her, and ask her indirectly as you easily may She will understand you and you will understand her without any painful explicitness You may count on the utmost goodwill from everyone ’ 

But it was the father who was going to be the uncertain factor Not that he disliked Max Muller On the contrary, even on that short acquaintance he had taken a fancy to him One of the Grenfell ladies said laughing that if Mr Muller were a lady Riversdale would want to marry him himself But Froude pointed out that he was a very odd person, and neither his wife nor he could answer for him ‘Words/ he went on to say, ‘which would bear the best interpretation with a man of a more normal land, cannot be interpreted with equal certainty in him He likes you exceedingly as a personal friend He has taken a fancy to you and will in all probability continue and like you better But the likelihood of an affection springing up between you and his daughter has probably never occurred to him as it would with any other father ’ 

All this advice and other admonitions were addressed to Muller by Froude between the end of December 1853 and the beginning of February 1854 One thing he specially warned Muller against, and that was precipitancy, haste and impulsiveness. But, characteristically, Muller could not bear the uncertainty, and he asked his friend to broach the question with Miss Grenfell So Froude wrote to her,

and on February 9 he informed his friend T have written I shall get an answer on Saturday and you will perhaps therefore on Sunday learn all you desire You know my heart is with you God bless you, dear fellow, in your future whatever it is to be \* Then he gave a very curious warning, and that about his brother-in-law Charles Kingsley ‘Avoid Kingsley in this matter, Don’t breathe it to him ’ 

Miss Grenfell’s reply to Froude is of such quality that I quote it m full 

RAY LODGE, Feb 10(1854) 

My dear Anthony, 

I do not wish to lose any time in answering your letter — which I do with a feeling of great regret at the idea that we may unconsciously have occasioned suffering to a person we all feel as much regard for as it is possible to do on so short an acquaintance as ours is with Mr Muller It certainly had not occurred to any of us to view him in the light of anything but a most agreeable and improving friend — and surrounded as we are — and as Georgy especially is, with frivolous and far inferior men, I have been glad to indulge my own taste for what is better and to give her when the opportunity occurred the benefit of such good society — I am truly grieved if in so doing we have led Mr Muller into any false views or expectations, but, after all, our meetings with him have been only three since the time you first brought him among us — at Oxford for two days — and one visit here of two hours before the last when he remained from Saturday till Monday On all these occasions there has only been general conversation and I am quite sure he has never had ten minutes’ real intercourse with G during the whole time Nothing in his manner has been the least marked or peculiar and I am sure she is quite ignorant of his feelings — being quite convinced that she likes his society as a most superior, agreeable man from whom there is always something to be learned and nothing more — I felt that the pleasure we all take in his visits might be safely indulged and when he came in on Saturday invited him to remain — this you will observe is the first invitation since Christmas — and the other in prospect is the London Madrigal Meeting to which my brother asked him Perhaps I am dwelling too long on all this, but I am anxious to prove that the degree of intercourse there has been could not have prepared us for this result 

To turn to the specific part of the subject — you must tell Mr Muller what I fear will be painful — that my brother considers G. too young to wish to have anything of the kind seriously proposed to her — that without an adequate provision for the future as well as the present he could not, however high a person’s character might be, listen to any-

thing of the kind — that we know far too little of Mr Muller, however that little may be appreciated by us all, to enter on such a question with him — and that I have not the least doubt if it was put before G herself she would at once desire it might go no further I have not mentioned the subject to her, nor shall I do so unless it would be a satisfaction to Mr Muller to have my words confirmed by her I think it may save awkwardness and discomfort in future if she is not told this — and I must add my sincere regret that under the circumstances I shall feel it right and wise not to ask him to our home again for his own sake and that it will be a loss and privation to us all My brother has an especial enjoyment in his society — and so I need not say have I — and I fear G ’s pleasure in listening to him and her interest in his conversation must have misled him for she has this in common with us all — but nothing beyond it 

I shall feel more sorry for all this if I could reproach myself with throwing them often together but both his visits lately paid were quite unexpected tho’ very welcome — and when here I know they had very little intercourse and that only with all the rest of the party — I cannot help wishing you had not been quite so discreet, for if I had the least idea of Mr in ’$ feelings I should never have exposed him to having them strengthened and I wonder he could suppose that I understood these when I gave him on his gomg away the last time such a cordial invitation to return often It would have been strange to do so if I had had anything of the kind in view, supposing that I had quite approved of it — I can truly say I have seldom met anyone I liked so much and I have no doubt that my manner has — tf he could suppose I understood him — helped to encourage his feeling, for it has expressed quite what I feel — as much regard and interest as on such a recent acquaintance I could feel I think it must be flattering to any young person to be preferred by such a Man, but it would be more so if it had been the result of a longer and more intimate acquaintance It is quite painful to me to have one agreeable — I would say valuable friendship broken up, and I trust nothing I have said will unnecessarily wound him As I shall tell G nothing I cannot help hoping at some future time when it is not painful to his feelings our intercourse may be renewed I will just add that I was obliged to mention the subject m a very hurried way to Riversdale this morning as he was gomg from home — but what I have said are his sentiments as well as mine 

I have written a long letter, but found it difficult to say all I wished m fewer words Pray let me know what you hear further of Mr Muller and give him my kindest regards 

Yours affectionately, 

G. in Grenfell

The letter was long, just short of one thousand words in length It would certainly not have been expected from a Victorian old maid by anyone who had taken the anti-Victorian fripperies of writers like Lytton Strachey seriously 

On February 13 Froude sent the letter to Max Muller and felt sure that on reflection Muller would see how reasonable much of what she said really was He himself felt that ‘it would have been wrong on so slight and brief an acquaintance to have written with decided encouragement’ His advice about the future was manly and sensible 

You will see [he wrote] that at present the very question will not be entertained If in our point of view it seems hard, on the other hand you have reason to be grateful for it, for when the question is not entertained there is no refusal The future is before you to make your way Let me entreat you to look at it in this way Take no steps which may force them to speak decidedly Above all, do not now think of going to Ray Lodge or of asking to be allowed to do so My dear Muller, everybody knows what your talents are Show now what your character is 

It seems Max Muller was not quite persuaded Therefore Froude wrote again on the 15th 

My dear Muller, I cannot see why because you cannot have what you wish at first asking for it, you should assume that it is beyond your reach for ever I have read in books, I have witnessed in life years of warm and loving devotion without hope, almost without desire of return, cheerfully and nobly offered It is beautiful to love and to be loved It is noble to love for true love's sake what is truly and really lovely 

Then he disclosed a secret about Miss Grenfell heiself, ‘Do you know,’ he wrote, ‘that Miss Grenfell herself has carried with her out of her young years the scars of a disappointment which will go with her into her grave ? When we meet people whom we admire how little do we guess the school in which they have been training ’ Froude could match his knowledge of the world with sensibility The Grenfell family, on its part, did not judge Muller harshly ‘On the contrary,’ Froude assured his friend, ‘she speaks of you with the very warmest affection and cannot find words to express the sorrow that both she and River sdale feel at the interruption of the

intercom be between you I would advise you to smother your feelings I tell you to hope gallantly ’ 

But even the intercourse was not to be interrupted In May the Grenfells were going again to Oxford, and Miss Grenfell wrote to Froude to tell Muller that as Georgina knew nothing of the past there was not the slightest unwillingness on their part to meet him, on the other hand there was every desire 

This closes the first stage of Max Muller’s courting of Georgina, when she knew nothing of what was going on The episode shows how superficial, untrue and malicious was the later running-down of the Victorians as stodgy, insensitive and snobbish people On the contrary, they had not undergone that erosion of the passionate side of the human personality which has certainly come about today, passion and sensuality not being exchangeable terms Only, the great Victorians knew that passion brought in its wake suffering just as it also did exultant happiness The suffering they tried to bear with stoicism and in silence, a type of behaviour not accessible to cleverness But even worldly Victorians could sense the stoicism and respect it The Grenfells did not sneer at Muller because without possessing money he had aspired after their daughter. Their worldlmess could go with an appreciation of unworldlmess.
