      <description>Friedrich Max Muller was bom on December 6, 1823, in the town of Dessau, now in eastern Germany, but then the capital of a sovereign State, though a very small one Indeed, Anhalt-Dessau was so small that when in the revolutionary days of mid-mneteenthcentury Germany, a troublesome political agitator was expelled from the principality he threatened to break the windows of the ruler’s palace by throwing stones from across the border That would have been, not petty mischief-making, but a very appropriate symbolic gesture, for the Schloss or the ducal palace was the focal point of the life of the whole population of the State, irrespective of class and station The building itself was both old and imposing, with a large quadrangle in front, from which staircases supported by turrets led up to the reception rooms The impression it made on Muller as a boy, he put in the mouth of the young hero of the only story he ever wrote</description>

WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER
Everything in Max Muller’s social antecedents, taken with his education which was typical for a young German of his birth and times, destined him for the career of an official or teacher But he exercised his own choice and launched himself into a vocation which, despite the feeling of uncertainty and groping he felt for many years, inevitably made him &amp;ldquo;the Erasmus of the nineteenth century Nevertheless the very first plan for settling him in the world envisaged an official’s life for him He was offered a position in the Austrian diplomatic service</description>

      <description>Chapter 3
FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER
When Max Muller ended his wander] ahre by taking up residence at Oxford, he was six months short of being twenty-five, and his personality, in its dual aspect of mind and character, was already formed in its structure and functioning After that, so far as his own development was concerned, he was to go on adding to the content of his mind But henceforth he was also to give his mind a new role — that of impinging on other minds as teacher and writer The publication of the first volume of his edition of the Rig-Veda in 1849 was symbolic of his transition from purely internal growth to external projection, which gained strength from year to year until m the last quarter of the nineteenth century he came to be accepted as one of the outstanding figures in the world of European thought At this point of transition it is necessary to take stock of his mind and character as these were then, and also to consider the influences which shaped them Perhaps the scope of this chapter will be more correctly stated if I say that in it I shall analyse young Muller’s personality as the product of a historical process What was distinctively personal in his qualities and activities will come out of the whole account of his life What it is necessary to examine here is the relationship between his personality and the particular environment, both social and psychological, in which he grew up This alone can place his individuality in its rightful historical setting The particularity of individual human-beings is geneially very much exaggerated, and in regarding every person as unique, as he in one sense certainly is, it is invariably forgotten that his particularity is only the psychological counterpart of what is known as continuous somatic variation in zoology, which makes every cat or dog equally particular It is only in the case of very exceptional persons that it is safe to attribute true individuality, and even then it cannot be assumed absolutely, for such men would also be found to be the products of a particular historical process Real originality is the surplus value which enables the exceptional man to give an added momentum to the process of which he is the product.</description>

      <description>Chapter 4
EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD
Max Muller came to Oxford in 1848, just in time to see the last years of the old, Laudian, Tory university, in which the part that was formally the university was a pool and almost unwanted relation of the colleges The year 1854, which saw the Oxford University Act become law on August 7, was as great a landmark in the academic history of Oxford as 1832 (the year of the first Reform Act) was in the political history of the British people Old Oxford did not disappear at once, but a process of transformation was set in motion, to continue for at least three decades until a new Oxford took a stable form</description>
