POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY
In his conscious formulation of an ideal of life Max Muller wanted to be a studious recluse, seeking knowledge and truth for their own sake, and believing that there must be a division of labour in human activities
None the less, all through life he was involving himself in political controversies, and showing himself eager to fight the opinions of majorities when they were baying in a pack out of nationalistic passions This was due to his interest in politics As a student in Germany he was a liberal nationalist As an adult scholar in England he remained the same liberal, and associated with the English Liberals At no age did he shrink from expressing his opinions in conversation or correspondence Though the realization of German unity and the creation of the German Empire in 1870 satisfied his nationalism, he never ceased to take an interest in Anglo-German friendship in the international field Even in his letters to his young son he set down his political views very freely</description>

LIFE, LOVE AND DEATH
From all the accounts that Max Muller gave of his intellectual aims, methods and work it could be seen that he was less a scholar m the strict sense of the word than an intellectual, and the difference is basic It is that which distinguishes a painter or sculptor from a craftsman What then is an intellectual ? An intellectual is a man or woman who applies his intellectual faculties to understanding and interpreting the world around him in any or all its aspects As a result of study, observation or experiment, he formulates conclusions which he believes to be true and communicates his ideas to his fellow-men with a view to influencing their minds, lives and actions</description>

      <description>Chapter 3
INDIA. MEN
When Max Muller told his son to grow fond of someone or something and so be raised to the intensity of a passion, he was thinking of his own life Whatever his love for someone might have brought him, his fondness for something never disappointed him That was India, adopted as a boy&amp;rsquo;s dream and pursued through life as an object of love Many people looked upon this as his great illusion It could be, for he could create an India of his own, as Pygmalion did with his Galatea Though absorbed in India all his life, he never visited the country In early life he could not because his mother thought that England was far enough His love affair and marriage also prevented it In middle age he was too busy at Oxford, and when old he felt that a visit to India would be too great a physical strain Among Indians the legend grew that he believed their country to have been the land of his previous birth, and that to see it might prove a fatal shock of joy</description>

      <description>Chapter 4
INDIA MOVEMENTS
It has been seen that all the scholarly researches of Max Muller had a practical side, or in any case practical implications For instance, in editing the Rig-Veda he always kept in mind the effect its publication might have on the religious life of contemporary Hindus He had the same end in view when, after completing his edition of the book, he took up the editorship of a gigantic corpus of the scriptures of the East under the general title of The Sacred Books of the East In addition, he kept himself in touch with all the important religious and social movements in India even when they were not directly connected with his scholarly work, and tried to promote those which he considered progressive In thus involving himself m the sphere of action from a distance he certainly produced results which were more tangible than those which Plato could bring about either at Athens or Syracuse</description>

VANAPRASTHA
The heading of this chapter is a Sanskrit word, which means to a Hindu the stage of life to be spent in a forest as enjoined by his sacred law This is the third state , the two preceding it are Brahmacharya (education and observance of chastity) and Garhasthya (family life), and that following Vanaprastha is Sannyasa (wanderings as a vagrant ascetic) Max Muller described the state in the following words in one of his books</description>
