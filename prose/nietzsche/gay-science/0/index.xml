      <description>The Gay Science is a remarkable book, both in itself and as offering a way into some of Nietzsche’s most important ideas. The history of its publication is rather complex, and it throws some light on the development of his thought and of his methods as a writer. He published the first edition of it in 1882. In that version, it consisted of only four books, and had no Preface, though it did have the ‘Prelude in Rhymes’.</description>

      <description>The standard biography of Nietzsche in English is R. J. Hollingdale, Nietzsche: The Man and his Philosophy, recently published in a revised and updated second edition (Cambridge University Press, 1999). Lesley Chamberlain’s Nietzsche in Turin: An Intimate Biography (Picador, 1997) gives a vivid picture of his life in the period during which he was at work on The Gay Science. There are two excellent general introductions to Nietzsche’s philosophy, a short book by Michael Tanner, Nietzsche (Oxford University Press, 1995) and a slightly longer and more technical book by Henry Staten, Nietzsche’s Voice (Cornell University Press, 1990).</description>

      <description>The text used for this translation is printed in the now standard edition of Nietzsche’s works edited by Giorgio Colli and Mazzino Montinari (Berlin, de Gruyter, 1967–77). Their edition, and that of Peter Pütz (Munich, Goldmann, 1994), have been used in the preparation of the footnotes to this edition.</description>

      <description>(‘La gaya scienza’)
This house is my own and here I dwell,
I’ve never aped nothing from no one
and – laugh at each master, mark me well,
who at himself has not poked fun.
Over my front door.
The title is a translation into German (in our edition, into English) of the Provencal subtitle. Gaya scienza (‘joyful, cheerful, or gay science’) was a term used by the troubadours in the twelfth to fourteenth centuries to refer to the art of poetry.</description>

      <description>Prelude in German Rhymes*
1. Invitation
Dare to taste my fare, dear diner!
Come tomorrow it tastes finer
and day after even good!
If you still want more – I’ll make it,
from past inspiration take it,
turning food for thought to food.
2. My Happiness
Since I grew weary of the search
I taught myself to find instead.
Since cross winds caused my ship to lurch
I sail with all winds straight ahead.</description>

      <description>To Goethe1
The ever-enduring
is merely your parable!
God the all-blurring
your fiction unbearable&amp;hellip;
World-wheel, the turning one
spawns goals each day:
Fate – sighs the yearning one,
the fool calls it – play.
World-play, the ruling one,
blends truth and tricks: –
The eternally fooling one
blends us – in the mix!&amp;hellip;
Vogelfrei is an archaic expression used to declare someone an outlaw, literally ‘free as a bird’, and therefore not to be sheltered.</description>
