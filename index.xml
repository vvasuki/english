The visitation on the knoll
It was the time Somakhya and Indrasena were by themselves — without their companions — for that is close to the ultimate test of a man. At that point, they were working on the mysterious three-gene system coding for an ATPase that had evolved from a GTPase, a mystery protein, and a RNase. While they had made an initial incision they were being rebuffed by it and it was testing Indrasena’s skills to the utmost.</description>

The crossover with Dabba Seṭṭhīputta
Ash It was a Śivarātrī. Vidrum accompanied his friends Somakhya and Lootika to visit the small shrine of Rudra in the cemetery beside his house. It was one of the rare days when the normally deserted cemetery was fairly busy with many a votary streaming in to pay homage at the shrine. Vidrum milled around a bit as his friends performed some japa at the side of the circumambulatory circuit of the shrine.</description>

The Dalāl who became a poltergeist
Lootika had returned from a scientific competition, which had been held in the dreadful city of Mahāvisphoṭaka, like the victorious Roman army after sacking the towns of West Asian counter-religionists. To both celebrate and to educate the class her teacher had organized an evening of sky-watching where Lootika was to introduce her often unruly classmates to the basics of astronomy. She knew well that beauty and success inspired anger and envy in many and that such a session could descend into the unsavory or worse quickly.</description>

The death of Miss Lizzie Willink
Late that spring, Somakhya and Lootika were visited by their mleccha friend Irmhild. Letting her sleep off the jet lag, they left for work. Given the good weather, Lootika returned early to check on their friend and go out with her prospecting spiders in the nearby woods for their work on endosymbionts.

Problem manifests This is the second of the two stories that arose from incidents during the visit of Yaśaśravas, Somakhya’s cousin. With the autumnal vacations, Somakhya was having a good time with his visiting cousin, giving him lectures on the theory and the practice of the study of variable stars. During the day, they spent their time with numerical solutions of differential equations that modeled the pulsations of stars.</description>

before us stood the bright prajApati,
with rudra’s bright dart pinning him to the welkin+++(=sky)+++.
In one hand we held an iron trident,
in the other we held a skull.
Beyond the carcass of prajapati
shone his wain+++(=carriage)+++, with the ruddy gem in it struck.

We had earlier commented how the Trojan horse, whom we used to call Chappal (slipper) in our days of youth was working his wonders with the Indian army. We had speculated that he was specifically an agent of the roguish pirate chief Ponting to do away with his main dangers before the invasion of the subcontinent. We have now got some intelligence as to how the Indian ants invited the parasitoid wasp Greg “Chappal” into their nest.</description>

With the fall of general Wright, the Hindu armies employed a new trainer in the form of the roguish chief from Southern Saxony, Chappell. we have long known Chappell to be an abrasive character, who has always had his own quirks. He quickly got into a conflict with the prince of Vanga and the brave Andhra grenadier from Vangipura. We believe that the Anglo-Saxon is a Trojan horse sent by the king of the Southern Whites to ruin the Hindu armies.</description>

The great leader of the Southern Saxon, Pirate king Slit-Eyes had died in the battle with the Hindus during their invasion of the southern continent. Slit-Eyes was succeeded by pirate Ponting, who was ably supported by the old guard of the Slit-Eyes empire, such as Gen. Hayden, bombardier McGrath, raider-in-chief Warnie, captains Langer and Gilchrist, Bishop Martyn and other saboteurs, Clarke, Gillespie and Lee. The Southern Saxons in the heydays of Slit-Eyes and Pirate Emperor Border, had engaged in many raiding operations on the Saxon mainland, and had fought many epic battle even as the pirates of the Caribbeans.</description>

Why is it that they call you Devang Gandhi when you were VVS Laxman?
Why is it that you are a hero of the Ranji pitch but deliver no more than an egg at the real Test grounds?
Why is it that you smash a Karthik outside the ground, but get out on the first ball to Warnie?</description>

The ruffians of Southern Saxony had always held the Indian armies in contempt. In one of the greatest battles of all times the princes of the Andhra and the Karnata country had destroyed the Saxon pride that had swelled in the great invasion of India in the year of 2001 under Emperor of all Saxony, Slit-Eyes+++(=nAsser Hussain?)+++. In the battle of Chennai the prince of Mumbai had put to sword the Southern Saxon army.</description>

I am indra,
the drinker of soma, without limit.
In the sumada of soma I slew namuchi with my vajra concealed in foam.
I am Indra,
the brahman known by R^ishis, the entire universe.
I slew kAlaka~njas, I crushed the paulomas and expelled them from existence.</description>

Males get to enjoy this wonderful steroid. The poets of the long past days may have called it loosener of kAma’s shara-s. It creates mathematical prowess where none existed previously and quickens activity like no other secretion. The mind starts conceiving what was previously unthinkable. It is on account of this that males get more violent, more innovative, and at times downright brilliant.

Charlotte narrated me a strange incidence as we were recuperating from a session in the wild observing local fungal genera. Normally I do not suffer such tales lightly, but on this occasion I found some strange connection with certain imprints from my own past, and accordingly listened to her in rapt attention. At that time Charlotte had just arrived from her native land and preceded me by an year to the big city where I was to later live.</description>

Mencken 7 Author’s Preface 37 The Antichrist 41 INTRODUCTION Save for his raucous, rhapsodical autobiography, “Ecce Homo,” “The Antichrist” is the last thing that Nietzsche ever wrote, and so it may be accepted as a statement of some of his most salient ideas in their final form. Notes for it had been accumulating for years and it was to have constituted the first volume of his long-projected magnum opus, “The Will to Power.</description>

      <description>Author intro FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE was born near Leipzig in 1844, the son of a Lutheran clergyman. He attended the famous Pforta School, then went to university at Bonn and at Leipzig, where he studied philology and read Schopenhauer. When he was only twenty-four he was appointed to the chair of classical philology at Basle University; he stayed there until his health forced him into retirement in 1879. While at Basle he made and broke his friendship with Wagner, participated as an ambulance orderly in the Franco-Prussian War, and published The Birth of Tragedy (1872), Untimely Meditations (1873–6) and the first two parts of Human, All Too Human (1878–9).</description>

      <description>HOW ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING.
&amp;ldquo;Zarathustra&amp;rdquo; is my brother’s most personal work; it is the history of his most individual experiences, of his friendships, ideals, raptures, bitterest disappointments and sorrows. Above it all, however, there soars, transfiguring it, the image of his greatest hopes and remotest aims. My brother had the figure of Zarathustra in his mind from his very earliest youth: he once told me that even as a child he had dreamt of him.</description>

      <description>Call me Ishmael.
Ishmael? In this year 2099 when strange new ships head beyond the stars instead of merely toward them? Attack the stars instead of fearing them? A name like Ishmael?
Yes.
My parents flew with the first brave ones to Mars. Turned less than brave, gone sick for Earth, they returned home. Conceived on that journey, I was born in space.
My father knew his Bible and recalled another outcast who wandered dead seas long years before Christ.</description>

      <description>There was a desert prairie filled with wind and sun and sagebrush and a silence that grew sweetly up in wildflowers. There was a rail track laid across this silence and now the rail track shuddered.
Soon a dark train charged out of the east with fire and steam and thundered through the station. On its way it slowed at a platform littered with confetti, the tatters of ancient tickets punched by transient conductors.</description>

      <description>—Let us look each other in the face. We are Hyperboreans—we know well enough how remote our place is. “Neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the Hyperboreans”: even Pindar,[1] in his day, knew that much about us. Beyond the North, beyond the ice, beyond death—our life, our happiness&amp;hellip;. We have discovered that happiness; we know the way; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth.</description>

      <description>The teachers of the purpose of existence. – Whether I regard human beings with a good or with an evil eye, I always find them engaged in a single task, each and every one of them: to do what benefits the preservation of the human race. Not from a feeling of love for the race, but simply because within them nothing is older, stronger, more inexorable and invincible than this instinct – because this instinct constitutes the essence of our species and herd.</description>

      <description>ZARATHUSTRA’S PROLOGUE. 1. When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the sun, and spake thus unto it:
Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest!</description>

      <description>Lady Blennerhasset, a well-known literary and social figure of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, wrote to Mrs Max Muller after the death of her husband ‘My admiration for your husband makes me envy the task of him or her, who will be his biographer There are few lives so rich, so attractive, so truly interesting, from the intellectual and purely human point of view ’
During the four years which I took to write this biography I have felt that she was right in saying so It has been a memorable experience for me, and not merely a task The introduction which follows will explain why I undertook to write Max Muller’s life anew after the first and last biography so far written was published in 1902 Here I shall only set down my obligations</description>

      <description>When I met Vimalananda I had already been living in the city of Poona for more than a year, studying Ayurveda, India&amp;rsquo;s ancient medical system, and yoga. I had spiritual ambitions but despite guidance from saintly personages I had no real idea of my ultimate spiritual aim. Still, I dutifully invested many hours each day in postures and breathing exercises, holy books, incense and meditation while I waited impatiently for something to happen.</description>

      <description>Friedrich Max Muller was bom on December 6, 1823, in the town of Dessau, now in eastern Germany, but then the capital of a sovereign State, though a very small one Indeed, Anhalt-Dessau was so small that when in the revolutionary days of mid-mneteenthcentury Germany, a troublesome political agitator was expelled from the principality he threatened to break the windows of the ruler’s palace by throwing stones from across the border That would have been, not petty mischief-making, but a very appropriate symbolic gesture, for the Schloss or the ducal palace was the focal point of the life of the whole population of the State, irrespective of class and station The building itself was both old and imposing, with a large quadrangle in front, from which staircases supported by turrets led up to the reception rooms The impression it made on Muller as a boy, he put in the mouth of the young hero of the only story he ever wrote</description>

O delusion and the cause of the bondage of manifestation.
She indeed is sovereign over all sovereigns.

      <description>“Yes, that is a separate thing, but it is still the same principle: the food acts as a carrier, a via media, for whatever vibrations are added to it. Remember that Shaktipat Diksha can be given with water, or with some other substance that the disciple ingests. Every time you eat something, you are imbibing unaware all sorts of vibrations, all sorts of shaktis, some of which may be very unbalancing to your system.</description>

      <description>FOREWORD 1 SEEING that I must shortly approach mankind with the heaviest demand that has ever been made on it, it seems to me indispensable to say who I am. This ought really to be known already: for I have not neglected to ‘bear witness’ about myself. But the disparity between the greatness of my task and the smallness of my contemporaries has found expression in the fact that I have been neither heard nor even so much as seen.</description>

      <description>Natural potential for spiritual development becomes valuable only by careful cultivation. All spiritual practices are sadhanas, but all sadhanas are not created equal. Vimalananda explains:
“The Rishis, India&amp;rsquo;s Seers, have understood our plight, and in their great magnanimity have created sadhanas by which we can extricate ourselves from our limitations and make progress. The Rishis have created many dif ferent sadhanas because there are so many different types of people, each of whom have special requirements.</description>

&amp;ldquo;You can. I am sure that if Tukaram Maharaj, who lived here in Maharashtra almost four hundred years ago, were to come here to Bombay today and we were to play some nice Western song for him he would sit quietly and listen and enjoy it—or at least he would look as if he were enjoying it.</description>

      <description>Chapter i
POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY
In his conscious formulation of an ideal of life Max Muller wanted to be a studious recluse, seeking knowledge and truth for their own sake, and believing that there must be a division of labour in human activities
None the less, all through life he was involving himself in political controversies, and showing himself eager to fight the opinions of majorities when they were baying in a pack out of nationalistic passions This was due to his interest in politics As a student in Germany he was a liberal nationalist As an adult scholar in England he remained the same liberal, and associated with the English Liberals At no age did he shrink from expressing his opinions in conversation or correspondence Though the realization of German unity and the creation of the German Empire in 1870 satisfied his nationalism, he never ceased to take an interest in Anglo-German friendship in the international field Even in his letters to his young son he set down his political views very freely</description>

      <description>“Actually there is no difference betwen the Kundalini Shakti and Adya, the original Shakti of the universe, except that the Kundalini Shakti has become individualized.”
Vimalananda was not one to repeat himself; as soon as he began to speak about something of interest to me I was expected to drop whatever I was doing and listen. Usually he picked moments when I was engrossed in some mundane matter like reading the newspaper, since drawing my atten tion to his words would disengage my mind at least temporarily from its attachment to the mundane.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The universe is endless and beginningless.&amp;rdquo; Vimalananda was in a mood to talk, and plenty of time lay before us. “If you are sincere and work hard you will eventually reach the state of continual awareness that you are the Universal Soul, the One, the Atman or Brahman. Then you can truthfully say to yourself, &amp;lsquo;Aham Brahmasmi; I am Brahman.&amp;rsquo; Our mortal consciousness has three normal states: waking, dream, and deep sleep.</description>

      <description>“WHY DO YOU THINK I own horses and come to the race track?&amp;quot;
Vimalananda and I sat, in March 1977, on his usual bench in the First En closure of the Bombay Racecourse. We had reached there well in advance of the first race, and while we awaited the arrival of his colleagues, the friendly gamblers with whom he would wrangle, wager and roar, the man who was my mentor sprang this question on me.</description>

      <description>Chapter I
THE RIG-VEDA
It took Max Muller five years of continuous labour, which was partly mechanical drudgery, to complete the editing and printing of only the first volume of his edition of the Rig-Veda To understand the spirit and motivation of this project as well as his interest in the wider field of Sanskrit literature as a whole, it is necessary to take note of a basic contrast , that which existed between the German and English attitudes towards India in his young days This is essential because in his own position there was an amalgamation of the two He began as a purely German Indophile and Indologist, and soon assumed the roles in their British form, without however losing his original affiliation and inspiration</description>

Valmiki was not born a Rishi; in fact, he was a bandit. His job was waylaying people and robbing them. Sometimes he would hold them for ransom, or even kill them. Occasionally he would let them go.</description>

      <description>In his youth Vimalananda had studied astrology with Jina Chandra Suri, and 1 frequently witnessed his amazing ability to cast an accurate horoscope from a visitor&amp;rsquo;s face alone. Though astrology is a respected means of diagno sis in Ayurveda it is no longer taught in Ayurvedic colleges, and I held out some hope that Vimalananda would teach me himself. But every time I asked for instruction he would refuse, saying, “You have more important things to learn right now.</description>

      <description>Yantra, meaning &amp;ldquo;device&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;instrument,&amp;rdquo; is usually a geometric repre sentation designed to identify the mind of a worshipper with his or her cho sen deity. The Yogini Tantra says that the goddess may either be worshipped as image, mandala or yantra. A yantra is the outward form of a deity, while a mantra is the deities&amp;rsquo; subtle form. In essence the mantra is the deity, and when a yantra is inscribed with its bija mantras and empowered by conse cration the deity is installed within the yantra.</description>

      <description>Oh, the logistics of the rocket. Computerize the billion and one decisions. Ten thousand nursing bottles filled with super-homogenized gunk for space children. Fresh air produced by glass-enclosed botanical gardens. Sweat recycled into sweet water by machines.
Ring all the bells and klaxons. Flash the lights and prepare the thunders. Men and women run.
Quell and I stood by the gantry, staring up at the giant ship. It had been a week since our strange encounter with Elijah, seven days filled with intense activity as the Cetus 7 crew, of which we were now members, prepared the ship for voyage.</description>

      <description>Because.
In his half-sleep last night he had felt something writing on the insides of his eyelids.
Without opening his eyes he read the words as they scrolled:
Somewhere a band is playing,
Playing the strangest tunes,
Of sunflower seeds and sailors
Somewhere a drummer simmers
And trembles with times forlorn,
Remembering days of summer
In futures yet unborn.
“Hold on,” he heard himself say.

      <description>What is good?—Whatever augments the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself, in man.
What is evil?—Whatever springs from weakness.
What is happiness?—The feeling that power increases—that resistance is overcome.
Not contentment, but more power; not peace at any price, but war; not virtue, but efficiency (virtue in the Renaissance sense, virtu, virtue free of moral acid).
The weak and the botched shall perish: first principle of our charity.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2
BEATA GEORGINA
There is a gap of two years in the story of Max Muller’s love for Georgina Grenfell, between the spring of 1854 when his proposal for marriage was rejected by her family, and the spring of 1856 when a love affair acknowledged and accepted by Georgina but without any hope of marriage began for them What happened in the intervening years is unrecorded both in the published biography and unpublished papers All that can be said is that Muller did not forget his love, and remained dejected But since he did not meet Georgina his suffering was not such that he could not put on a brave face to his mother, as he felt he must, because he knew that nothing would distress her more than the knowledge of his being unhappy in love So, to one of her letters written in 1855, in which there was the usual insistence on his marrying and even a suggestion as to a possible wife, he replied with humour ‘That you are so anxious to find me a wife is very good of you 1 Elise who delighted you so much in Carlsbad, seemed to me pleasant enough, but as I had no opportunity of knowing her better, I have never thought more about her If you are writing greet her kindly, but don’t make any proposal for her hand*’ The future Mrs Muller, on the othei hand, knew nothing of Max Muller’s love and was not herself consciously in love But the whole aspect of their relations changed dramatically in the early summer of 1856</description>

      <description>“While Kundalini sleeps in the Muladhara Chakra at the base of the spine you are awake to the world and asleep to reality. When She awakes to unite with Her Shiva in your brain then you wake up to reality; you &amp;lsquo;fall asleep&amp;rsquo; to the world. An ignorant person believes that he is in the world; his Kundalini self-identifies with the poison of Maya. A jnani, one who knows, says rather, ‘The world is in me,&amp;rsquo; because his Kundalini self-identifies with Shiva.</description>

      <description>I MET VIMALANANDA first in September 1975 on the day that Elan, one of his most reliable mares, won her first race for him. I first accompanied him to the races on the day of Stoney&amp;rsquo;s last outing. Horse racing began in Bombay in the early decades of the nineteenth century when a race ground emerged in what is now the predominantly Christian district of Byculla. When the time came to search for greener pastures, the Royal Western India Turf Club Limited (R.</description>

      <description>The fact that Max Muller was German by birth and spent his early life in Germany, has quite unnecessarily fixed the idea that he was a German scholar writing in German Actually, he was naturalized in England and always wrote in English with complete mastery of the language, except when he employed German for a special purpose in a book, article, or his correspondence The lists given in the two appendices specify which books or documents are in German All others are in his own English</description>

      <description>The Gay Science is a remarkable book, both in itself and as offering a way into some of Nietzsche’s most important ideas. The history of its publication is rather complex, and it throws some light on the development of his thought and of his methods as a writer. He published the first edition of it in 1882. In that version, it consisted of only four books, and had no Preface, though it did have the ‘Prelude in Rhymes’.</description>

      <description>It is always better to live with reality, because otherwise, without fail, reality will come to live with you. —The Aghori Vimalananda
IF TO BE RELIGIOUS, in the truest sense of that much misunderstood word, is to thirst for water from reality&amp;rsquo;s fountain, then to walk the spiritual path is to turn your compass toward its ever-flowing well. The organized reli gions, which have set up camps downstream from that spring, all provide sketchy maps that trace a single trail to the source.</description>

      <description>He described it one evening shortly thereafter, over Scotch.
“My family belongs to the Pushti Marga, the spiritual path (marga) whose greatest exponent was Vallabhacharya, who lived more than five hundred years ago. Some people translate &amp;lsquo;Pushti Marga&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;Path of Prosperity,&amp;rsquo; and others as ‘Path of Grace.&amp;rsquo; But when I think of pushti I remember a phrase from the Maha Mrytunjaya Mantra.” He looked at me expectantly.

LIFE, LOVE AND DEATH
From all the accounts that Max Muller gave of his intellectual aims, methods and work it could be seen that he was less a scholar m the strict sense of the word than an intellectual, and the difference is basic It is that which distinguishes a painter or sculptor from a craftsman What then is an intellectual ? An intellectual is a man or woman who applies his intellectual faculties to understanding and interpreting the world around him in any or all its aspects As a result of study, observation or experiment, he formulates conclusions which he believes to be true and communicates his ideas to his fellow-men with a view to influencing their minds, lives and actions</description>

      <description>Every month or two, when the mood possessed him, Vimalananda would take me and Roshni with him to the Lakshmi-Narayana temple in Central Bombay, to look upon the face of God. The images in this temple are carved from pure white marble, and their sweetness and sublimity effortlessly pierce the hearts of those who gaze at them in faith. All the humans there the temple trustees, the priests, the watchmen&amp;ndash;knew Vimalananda, and all were happy to see him arrive, all except the musicians, who were envious of his superior musical abilities.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;But since right now I do know what time it is,” I said, “all these anustha nas and so on will not only help awaken my mantra but will also help me develop my devotion.”
“That&amp;rsquo;s right.” &amp;ldquo;Are there other practices I should know about?” I asked, knowing well that he expected me to continue asking even if I did not know what to ask.
&amp;ldquo;Well, there is nyasa. Very few people talk about nyasa, because so few people know about it.</description>

      <description>“You know, the whole purpose of Tantra is to free us from all limitations. The world is full of negative influences that limit our consciousnesses, and one of the greatest of these limitations is that of the Five Great Elements which make up the universe. If you can purify these Elements within you you can free yourself from their influence, and then your Kundalini will be free to rise unimpeded. As I have told you before, Bhuta Shuddhi is the essence of Tantra.</description>

      <description>After pausing to light a cigarette, Vimalananda continued.
“To become a Siddha is wonderful-marvelous&amp;ndash;but it is not the ulti mate. If your Kundalini should ever reach the Sahasrara you will see so many things that you will be amazed. You will see hundreds and hundreds of flow ers of all colors. Each of those flowers is a shakti, and if you pluck one of them you will get that shakti, which will keep you on the periphery.</description>

      <description>When I’m disgusted, fed up with the world, I always turn to my Mother. She comes to me in any form I request, and we play that way. Sometimes She comes as my Mother, sometimes as my wife, sometimes as my child. She’s always with me; She’ll never go away. Long ago we promised each other to stay together always. If She ever leaves me I will not live even an instant longer.</description>

      <description>a
The tradition of the Nine Nath Siddhas stems from the flowering of Shai vite Tantra around the tenth century. The word Nath is derived from the name of Shiva and its literal meaning is &amp;ldquo;Lord.&amp;rdquo; The Naths brought to light various systems of tantric practices aimed at the transubrantation of the human body into a divine immortal body. Central to their methods were the practices of Hatha, Kundalini and Alchemical yogas.</description>

      <description>“Rama, the Indwelling Spirit, is called Raja (King) Rama because He is king of the seventy-two thousand nadis. Krishna also rules the nadis, but His Lila is different; He has a love affair with them. Some people find it eas ier to relate to the Soul as King; others prefer to relate to It as Lover. You must find which way agrees best with your temperament, and relate in that way.</description>

“That is the job of your guru, to assign you the proper mantra and the proper form. He will know which mantras are appropriate for you. If you are of a very tender nature and you start to repeat a mantra for some terrifying deity like Smashan Tara you may scare yourself to death. If you are prone to greed and you worship Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, you may simply enhance your greed, which will not help you progress.</description>

WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER
Everything in Max Muller’s social antecedents, taken with his education which was typical for a young German of his birth and times, destined him for the career of an official or teacher But he exercised his own choice and launched himself into a vocation which, despite the feeling of uncertainty and groping he felt for many years, inevitably made him &amp;ldquo;the Erasmus of the nineteenth century Nevertheless the very first plan for settling him in the world envisaged an official’s life for him He was offered a position in the Austrian diplomatic service</description>

      <description>1 THE fortunateness of my existence, its uniqueness perhaps, lies in its fatality: to express it in the form of a riddle, as my father I have already died, as my mother I still live and grow old. This twofold origin, as it were from the highest and the lowest rung of the ladder of life, at once décadent and beginning – this if anything explains that neutrality, that freedom from party in relation to the total problem of life which perhaps distinguishes me.</description>

The crew all hurried to their assigned stations, suited up and strapped in. The great doors were shut and sealed, the gantries rolled away, the engines fired up.
“Minus one and counting.”
We lay waiting for the fire-wind to seize and throw us at the sky.
And seize and throw it did.
Oh my God, I thought.</description>

Well, now, he thought, as he peered down the tracks. This place isn’t on the map. But when the train slowed, I jumped, because …
He turned and saw a wind-battered sign over the flimsy station that seemed about to sink under tides of sand: SUMMERTON, ARIZONA.
“Yes, sir,” said a voice.
The traveler dropped his gaze to find a man of some middle years with fair hair and clear eyes seated on the porch of the ramshackle station, leaning back in shadow.</description>

      <description>The problem that I set here is not what shall replace mankind in the order of living creatures (—man is an end—): but what type of man must be bred, must be willed, as being the most valuable, the most worthy of life, the most secure guarantee of the future.
This more valuable type has appeared often enough in the past: but always as a happy accident, as an exception, never as deliberately willed.</description>

      <description>Noble and common. – For common natures all noble, magnanimous feelings appear to be inexpedient and therefore initially incredible: they give a wink when they hear of such things and seem to want to say, ‘Surely there must be some advantage involved; one cannot see through every wall’ – they are suspicious of the noble person, as if he were furtively seeking his advantage. If they become all too clearly convinced of the absence of selfish intentions and gains, they view the noble person as a kind of fool: they despise him in his pleasure and laugh at the sparkle in his eye.</description>

      <description>Vimalananda explains the concept thusly (from Chapter Two): “The purpose of Kundalini Yoga is to reunite Shiva and Shakti, to create the eternal form of Shiva, Sadashiva. Sadashiva&amp;rsquo;s left side is female and right side is male; the two principles have united but have not merged. If they were to merge that would be the end of the play, and that would be no fun at all. Sadashiva exists on the cosmic scale; in an indi vidual this deity is called Ardhanarishvara (“the Lord Who is Half Female&amp;rsquo;).</description>

      <description>Vimalananda paused for a moment and looked up to an image of Anjaneya, better known as Hanuman. His lip quivered almost imperceptibly with emotion as he spoke again.
&amp;ldquo;Anjaneya flew to Lanka, located Sita, and assured her that Rama was coming to rescue her. Before returning to Rama with the news of Sita&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts Anjaneya allowed himself to be captured and taken before Ravana to make Ravana aware of the gravity of what he had done.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3
FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER
When Max Muller ended his wander] ahre by taking up residence at Oxford, he was six months short of being twenty-five, and his personality, in its dual aspect of mind and character, was already formed in its structure and functioning After that, so far as his own development was concerned, he was to go on adding to the content of his mind But henceforth he was also to give his mind a new role — that of impinging on other minds as teacher and writer The publication of the first volume of his edition of the Rig-Veda in 1849 was symbolic of his transition from purely internal growth to external projection, which gained strength from year to year until m the last quarter of the nineteenth century he came to be accepted as one of the outstanding figures in the world of European thought At this point of transition it is necessary to take stock of his mind and character as these were then, and also to consider the influences which shaped them Perhaps the scope of this chapter will be more correctly stated if I say that in it I shall analyse young Muller’s personality as the product of a historical process What was distinctively personal in his qualities and activities will come out of the whole account of his life What it is necessary to examine here is the relationship between his personality and the particular environment, both social and psychological, in which he grew up This alone can place his individuality in its rightful historical setting The particularity of individual human-beings is geneially very much exaggerated, and in regarding every person as unique, as he in one sense certainly is, it is invariably forgotten that his particularity is only the psychological counterpart of what is known as continuous somatic variation in zoology, which makes every cat or dog equally particular It is only in the case of very exceptional persons that it is safe to attribute true individuality, and even then it cannot be assumed absolutely, for such men would also be found to be the products of a particular historical process Real originality is the surplus value which enables the exceptional man to give an added momentum to the process of which he is the product.</description>

INDIA. MEN
When Max Muller told his son to grow fond of someone or something and so be raised to the intensity of a passion, he was thinking of his own life Whatever his love for someone might have brought him, his fondness for something never disappointed him That was India, adopted as a boy&amp;rsquo;s dream and pursued through life as an object of love Many people looked upon this as his great illusion It could be, for he could create an India of his own, as Pygmalion did with his Galatea Though absorbed in India all his life, he never visited the country In early life he could not because his mother thought that England was far enough His love affair and marriage also prevented it In middle age he was too busy at Oxford, and when old he felt that a visit to India would be too great a physical strain Among Indians the legend grew that he believed their country to have been the land of his previous birth, and that to see it might prove a fatal shock of joy</description>

&amp;ldquo;When Kundalini enters the Anahata Chakra you begin to hear the Ana hata Nada, which will sound either like Krishna&amp;rsquo;s flute or Shiva&amp;rsquo;s drum depending on which path you follow. Other Nadas are also described in the books, but these two are the most important.
“Let me try to explain to you the differences in Nada by describing how Krishna&amp;rsquo;s hair differs from Shiva&amp;rsquo;s hair.</description>

To Max Muller the Rig-Veda , which kept him occupied fully or partly for thirty years, was only a means to an end Not that he ever underrated the value of the means, absolute or relative, on the contrary, he emphasized its importance so much that people might justifiably have thought of him as a man who was riding a hobbyhorse Conscious of this, he again and again made out a case for studying the Rig-Veda Nevertheless, the establishment of its text and that of Sayana’s commentary, followed by an attempt to understand its meaning, was to him the preliminary investigation in a wider quest — the examination, in a particular field, of phenomena he was primarily interested in and wanted to understand In short, his work on the Rtg-Veda could be compared to the experiments carried out by a theoretical physicist or, better still, to the investigations of Darwin</description>

Physical worship is always limited, especially now during Kali Yuga, when not even the experts are always able to do their physical worship properly. Even the most proficient devotee must occasionally make a mistake in his or her ritual; even the best trained mouth must sometimes mispronounce a mantra.</description>

It resides in the subtle body, and moves in the nadis, the ethereal nerves. The body&amp;rsquo;s 72,000 nadis act as con duits for prana, which is closely related to the ego. Numerologically, 72,000 means 7 + 2 = 9: the Nine Doors through which prana can enter or leave the body.</description>

      <description>BOMBAY&amp;rsquo;S SUMMER USUALLY begins near the end of March. With the summer of 1977 summer came the problem of where to send Stoney to brood. Pedigrees of all sorts fascinated Vimalananda; when we watched Wimbledon together he would sigh and say, “If only Jimmy Connors and Chrissy Evert would get together, their child would really be something!!” Now he had the opportunity to select the genes that would mingle with those of his beloved Stoney.</description>

The purpose of these rules is to achieve the sa-guna or mr anifested form of the deity. You know Sanskrit; translate these words.”
&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Sthana&amp;rsquo; means location.”
&amp;ldquo;So first you must stay in one location throughout the duration of your penance and not travel about. Moreover, you must sit in the same place each day, face in the same direction, and if possible sit in the same posi tion.</description>

This is especially true if, like an Aghori, you are in a hurry to succeed, and you decide to practice dangerous sadhanas like Panchamakara.</description>

      <description>1 − WHY do I know a few more things? Why am I so clever altogether? I have never reflected on questions that are none − I have not squandered myself. − I have, for example, no experience of actual religious difficulties. I am entirely at a loss to know to what extent I ought to have felt ‘sinful’. I likewise lack a reliable criterion of a pang of conscience: from what one bears of it, a pang of conscience does not seem to me anything respectable… I should not like to leave an act in the lurch afterwards, I would as a matter of principle prefer to leave the evil outcome, the consequences, out of the question of values.</description>

“How did you guess?”
“What?” said the driver.

      <description>Mankind surely does not represent an evolution toward a better or stronger or higher level, as progress is now understood. This “progress” is merely a modern idea, which is to say, a false idea. The European of today, in his essential worth, falls far below the European of the Renaissance; the process of evolution does not necessarily mean elevation, enhancement, strengthening.
True enough, it succeeds in isolated and individual cases in various parts of the earth and under the most widely different cultures, and in these cases a higher type certainly manifests itself; something which, compared to mankind in the mass, appears as a sort of superman.</description>

      <description>What preserves the species. – The strongest and most evil spirits have so far done the most to advance humanity: time and again they rekindled the dozing passions – every ordered society puts the passions to sleep –, time and again they reawakened the sense of comparison, of contradiction, of delight in what is new, daring, unattempted; they forced men to pit opinion against opinion, ideal model against ideal model. Mostly by force of arms, by toppling boundary stones, by violating pieties – but also by means of new religions and moralities!</description>

Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful? And what in the world hath caused more suffering than the follies of the pitiful?
Woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their pity!
Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: &amp;ldquo;Even God hath his hell: it is his love for man.&amp;rdquo;
And lately did I hear him say these words: &amp;ldquo;God is dead: of his pity for man hath God died.</description>

      <description>Chapter 4
EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD
Max Muller came to Oxford in 1848, just in time to see the last years of the old, Laudian, Tory university, in which the part that was formally the university was a pool and almost unwanted relation of the colleges The year 1854, which saw the Oxford University Act become law on August 7, was as great a landmark in the academic history of Oxford as 1832 (the year of the first Reform Act) was in the political history of the British people Old Oxford did not disappear at once, but a process of transformation was set in motion, to continue for at least three decades until a new Oxford took a stable form</description>

      <description>Aghora, described in this volume as “super-tantra,” is a Path of Devotion to the Great Mother Goddess Kundalini, here manifesting with the Name and Image of the Goddess Tara. This Way is one of extraordinary extremes and intensities, even for tantra, and its aim is nothing less than to destroy the human limitations of the practitioner, so that he or she becomes a super human&amp;ndash;in fact, a kind of deity.</description>

      <description>The standard biography of Nietzsche in English is R. J. Hollingdale, Nietzsche: The Man and his Philosophy, recently published in a revised and updated second edition (Cambridge University Press, 1999). Lesley Chamberlain’s Nietzsche in Turin: An Intimate Biography (Picador, 1997) gives a vivid picture of his life in the period during which he was at work on The Gay Science. There are two excellent general introductions to Nietzsche’s philosophy, a short book by Michael Tanner, Nietzsche (Oxford University Press, 1995) and a slightly longer and more technical book by Henry Staten, Nietzsche’s Voice (Cornell University Press, 1990).</description>

      <description>Vimalananda delivered the next in this series of musings at a Ganesha temple. I can no longer recall which temple it was, for he was very fond of Ganesha and we paid regular visits to several images of the elephant-headed god. The area around Poona has been associated with Ganesha worship for centuries, and Ganesha is still one of the most beloved of deities of that region.
After we had finished our worship and were relaxing, he began to address me thus:</description>

INDIA MOVEMENTS
It has been seen that all the scholarly researches of Max Muller had a practical side, or in any case practical implications For instance, in editing the Rig-Veda he always kept in mind the effect its publication might have on the religious life of contemporary Hindus He had the same end in view when, after completing his edition of the book, he took up the editorship of a gigantic corpus of the scriptures of the East under the general title of The Sacred Books of the East In addition, he kept himself in touch with all the important religious and social movements in India even when they were not directly connected with his scholarly work, and tried to promote those which he considered progressive In thus involving himself m the sphere of action from a distance he certainly produced results which were more tangible than those which Plato could bring about either at Athens or Syracuse</description>

OXFORD-DARK AND BRIGHT
By the time Max Muller, as Taylorian Professor, had become an associate member, so to speak, of the academic club of Oxford — the date being February 1854 — the university had ceased to be the happy convent it was even in 1848 The Pax Oxomana was shattered at one stroke by the appointment of the Royal Commission of 1850 As Mark Pattison said, if a man had fallen asleep in 1846 and woken up again in 1850 he would have found himself in a different world It was tom into two factions, the opponents and the supporters of reform The old guard was in power, and feeling ran so high against the renegades that one of them asked a junior professor to invite him to dinner because the heads of colleges would no longer admit him to their table Actually, the Commission made a difference to the social habits of Oxford Before its appointment there were hardly any private dinners besides those in the halls But the Commission broke up the academic society into sets, and private dinners had to keep up the social life of those who were excluded from the high table on account of their support for reform</description>

      <description>Vimalananda lit yet another cigarette. &amp;ldquo;Nothing is ever lost in the universe. Even things which happened mil lions of years ago can still be known, because their sound still exists. Sound, which is vibration, a series of waves, can be transmitted in many ways. Light can carry sound; even modern science has proved this. Humans usually perceive sound via molecules of air that vibrate; in light something else vibrates, but sound is there within light all the same.</description>

THE PRIMAL DEBT
What is the purpose of being born? To recognize yourself, to realize that you are neither the body nor the mind but rather the Eternal Soul which is the Ultimate Unity — call it Atma, Parampurusha, Brahman, or what you like.
How is one born into the world, though?</description>

      <description>Some days later when I was in Bombay I accompanied Vimalananda on an uneventful visit to K., one of his old friends. Afterward I noticed that Vim alananda was quieter than usual, so after we reached home and had tea I casually asked him, &amp;ldquo;Have you known that gentleman for very long?&amp;rdquo;

I had grinned at the comparison, and now I grinned at his affront. He snorted and went on.</description>

      <description>IN EARLY 1978 I was introduced to Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s newest horse, a hand some compact colt named Timir, when I watched him win his first race. This occasion was also noteworthy for me—it was the first time I had been able to cheer home one of Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s horses..and I found winning to be as electrifying a feeling as he had promised it would be. For the first time I un derstood the seduction of that sensation, how for sporting types like Vima lananda each victory could be as thrilling as his first.</description>

I shall do so as perfunctorily as is fitting: for the time for this question has certainly not yet come.

      <description>At which moment an old-fashioned ice wagon with a full dark cavern mouth of frost entered the yard, led by a horse in dire need of his Antarctic cargo. Cardiff could taste the ice, from thirty summers long gone.
“Just in time,” said the iceman. “Hot day. Go grab.” He nodded toward the rear of his wagon.
Cardiff, on pure instinct, jumped down from the bread wagon and went straight to the back of the ice wagon, and felt his ten-year-old hand reach in and grab a sharp icicle.</description>

      <description>We should not deck out and embellish Christianity: it has waged a war to the death against this higher type of man, it has put all the deepest instincts of this type under its ban, it has developed its concept of evil, of the Evil One himself, out of these instincts—the strong man as the typical reprobate, the “outcast among men.” Christianity has taken the part of all the weak, the low, the botched; it has made an ideal out of antagonism to all the self-preservative instincts of sound life; it has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are intellectually most vigorous, by representing the highest intellectual values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation.</description>

      <description>This book is a biography, that is to say, an account of the life of a man who was a scholar and a thinker, it is not except incidentally a discussion or evaluation of his work in the fields of knowledge with which his scholarship was concerned But a biography should not be inflicted on a reading public without proper justification, I do not think that a man is entitled to such treatment only on the strength of his position and fame in his own age, unless in addition he played so important and significant a role in history that he remains an element to be reckoned with in understanding the continuing evolution of a particular people or humanity in general; nor unless his personality and activities belong to a type whose presence and functiomng is continuous and umversal, so that no outstanding individual of the type ever loses his relevance to all ages</description>

      <description>Nature is very kind to me; in fact, as my friend Faram used to say, Nature is cockeyed to me. And that is because of my mentors. My mentors were very good. That’s all I can say; my mentors were very good. Maybe it’s true I was meant by Nature to succeed at all my sadhanas, but my mentors triggered me up and made me succeed. They were too good.</description>

      <description>The text used for this translation is printed in the now standard edition of Nietzsche’s works edited by Giorgio Colli and Mazzino Montinari (Berlin, de Gruyter, 1967–77). Their edition, and that of Peter Pütz (Munich, Goldmann, 1994), have been used in the preparation of the footnotes to this edition.</description>

      <description>I could see that mantras were really very useful things. “Telling your mantra to someone else is fatal, but there are other mistakes which can also ruin you. Mispronunciation is one of the worst. The way a word is pronounced has a lot to do with its meaning. For instance, when you come in and I say, &amp;lsquo;Hello, Robby, how are you?&amp;rsquo; with a pleasant voice and a smiling face, how do you feel?</description>

      <description>I had to shake my head in appreciation and agreement, it was so true.
“To make Kundalini rise from the tip of the spine you must create enough pressure to force Her out of the Muladhara Chakra. The upward motion will continue only so long as the pressure remains; without it Kundalini drops back down to the bottom, due to gravity. Because humans stand erect, grav ity acts only on the tip of the spinal cord, not on the whole thing as it does in other animals, whose spines are horizontal or nearly so.</description>

      <description>STONEY FAILED TO GET into foal at Vitu Karve&amp;rsquo;s stud farm even in early 1978, due at least in part to Vitu&amp;rsquo;s unwillingness to spend much money on her feed. Vimalananda soon decided to send her elsewhere, but where? All the other stud farms insisted on seeing the color of his coin. When things seemed bleakest Nature stepped in, as She usually did for Vimalananda in a pinch. This time She arrived in the form of Mr.</description>

      <description>1 IN order to be just to ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ (1872) one will have to forget a few things. It made its effect and even exercised fascination through what was wrong with it − through its application to Wagnerism, as if this were a symptom of a beginning. That is what made this book an event in Wagner’s life: it was only from then on that great hopes surrounded the name Wagner.</description>

      <description>During the afternoons Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s conversation usually revolved around the racecourse, since most of the people who dropped by to see him at that time were interested in the hot tips which are the sustenance of those who gamble on horses. Those who were more interested in hearing him dis cuss spirituality would come in the evenings, when he would relax and let his mind focus on Reality. One night, after overhearing a couple of his spiri tual “children&amp;quot; speaking knowingly of “devotion” and “knowledge,” he felt a need to put the record straight:</description>

“Being immortal the Rishis are not subject to time as we know it. They have gone beyond the reach of Mahakala, the God of Death, whose name is Time.</description>

VANAPRASTHA
The heading of this chapter is a Sanskrit word, which means to a Hindu the stage of life to be spent in a forest as enjoined by his sacred law This is the third state , the two preceding it are Brahmacharya (education and observance of chastity) and Garhasthya (family life), and that following Vanaprastha is Sannyasa (wanderings as a vagrant ascetic) Max Muller described the state in the following words in one of his books</description>

      <description>Only as creators! – This has caused me the greatest trouble and still does always cause me the greatest trouble: to realize that what things are called is unspeakably more important than what they are. The reputation, name, and appearance, the worth, the usual measure and weight of a thing – originally almost always something mistaken and arbitrary, thrown over things like a dress and quite foreign to their nature and even to their skin – has, through the belief in it and its growth from generation to generation, slowly grown onto and into the thing and has become its very body: what started as appearance in the end nearly always becomes essence and effectively acts as its essence!</description>

      <description>We artists. – When we love a woman, we easily come to hate nature because of all the repulsive natural functions to which every woman is subject; we prefer not to think about it at all, but when our soul for once brushes against these matters, it shrugs impatiently and, as just said, casts a contemptuous look at nature: we feel insulted; nature seems to intrude on our property and with the most profane hands at that.</description>

      <description>Deep in the false night, our captain walked along the sleeping quarter corridors. Quell scanned his mind and spoke his words to me in whispers: “‘What, pretending at sleep? Do that, and bite your bitter tongues, which hate me for spoiled games. But if Christ Himself walked through space this night—’”
And Quell, speaking in his own voice, added: “Not Christ. But one of His lost shepherds.”
The next morning, Redleigh summoned Quell and me to Small’s communication console.</description>

      <description>James Cardiff stood in quiet amazement.
The front porch of the Egyptian View Arms was the longest he had ever seen. It had so many white wicker rockers he stopped counting. Occupying some of the rockers was an assortment of youngish not quite middle-aged gentlemen, nattily dressed, with slicked-back hair, fresh out of the shower. And interspersed among the men were late-thirties-not-yet-forty women in summer dresses looking as if they had all been cut from the same rose or orchid or gardenia wallpaper.</description>

      <description>It is a painful and tragic spectacle that rises before me: I have drawn back the curtain from the rottenness of man. This word, in my mouth, is at least free from one suspicion: that it involves a moral accusation against humanity. It is used—and I wish to emphasize the fact again—without any moral significance: and this is so far true that the rottenness I speak of is most apparent to me precisely in those quarters where there has been most aspiration, hitherto, toward “virtue” and “godliness.</description>

      <description>Loss of dignity. – Reflection has lost all its dignity of form: we have made a laughing-stock of the ceremony and solemn gestures of reflection, and couldn’t stand an old-style wise man. We think too fast, while on our way somewhere, while walking or in the midst of all sorts of business, even when thinking of the most serious things; we need little preparation, not even much silence: it is as if we carried around in our heads an unstoppable machine that keeps working even under the most unfavourable circumstances.</description>

      <description>When I look at someone I don’t see them as they are now; I see them as they will be. Then I can try to change them if there is something in them I think I can change. If I love skin and bones how will I be able to help them? Skin and bones will only decay, but the individual will continue to exist even after death. That is why I can say that I love people not for their present value but for their future value; not for what they are but for what they will become, or for what they have the potential to become.</description>

&amp;ldquo;It is very beautiful.”
&amp;ldquo;A Rishi&amp;rsquo;s wife is an amazing being in her own right. What about Anasuya, the wife of the Rishi Atri? Her very name means &amp;lsquo;absence of envy.&amp;rsquo; What more could one want in a wife? And just as she was without envy, everyone was envious of her. Even Lakshmi, Sarasvati and Parvati, the wives of Vishnu, Brahma and Shiva, became envious of her, and one day they got together and decided to tell their husbands to go and disturb her penance so she would not stand out as the example of what a wife should be.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I have always said that life is a memory. There are actually two types of memory: conscious and unconscious. The conscious memory is very fickle and inconstant; it is directed outwards towards mundane objects, which are temporary and transitory but seem eternal to the ignorant mind. The unconscious memory is permanent; it has been collecting all your karmas from tens of millions of births without any lapse or distortion. So the uncon scious memory is actually conscious, since it perfectly records everything that happens to you, and the conscious memory is actually unconscious.</description>

I’ve never aped nothing from no one
and – laugh at each master, mark me well,
who at himself has not poked fun.
Over my front door.
The title is a translation into German (in our edition, into English) of the Provencal subtitle. Gaya scienza (‘joyful, cheerful, or gay science’) was a term used by the troubadours in the twelfth to fourteenth centuries to refer to the art of poetry.</description>

      <description>1 THE four untimely essays are altogether warlike. They demonstrate that I was no ‘Jack o’ Dreams’, that I derive pleasure from drawing the sword − also, perhaps, that I have a dangerously supple wrist. The first attack (1873) was on German culture, which even at that time I already looked down on with remorseless contempt. Without meaning, without substance, without aim: a mere ‘public opinion’. There is no more vicious misunderstanding than to believe that the Germans’ great success in arms could demonstrate anything in favour of this culture − not to speak of its victory over France… The second untimely essay (1874) brings to light what is dangerous, what gnaws at and poisons life, in our way of carrying on science −: life sick with this inhuman clockwork and mechanism, with the ‘impersonality’ of the worker, with the false economy of ‘division of labour’.</description>

      <description>In honour of friendship. – That the feeling of friendship was in antiquity considered the highest feeling, even higher than the most celebrated pride of the self-sufficient sage, indeed, as it were, as its sole and even holier sibling: this is very well expressed in the story of the Macedonian king who gave a world-despising Athenian philosopher a talent and got it back. ‘What?’ said the king, ‘Has he then no friend?</description>

      <description>Sceptics. – I am afraid that old women in their most secret heart of hearts are more sceptical than all men: they believe the superficiality of existence to be its essence, and all virtue and depth is to them merely a veil over this ‘truth’, the very desirable veil over a pudendum – in other words, a matter of decency and shame, and no more!</description>

      <description>Devotion. – There are noble women with a certain poverty of spirit who know no other way to express their deepest devotion than to offer their virtue and sense of shame: it is what they hold as their highest possession. And often this gift is accepted without incurring as profound an obligation as the donors suppose – a very melancholy story!</description>

      <description>The strength of the weak. – All women are subtle at exaggerating their weaknesses; indeed they are inventive at weaknesses in order to appear as utterly fragile ornaments that are harmed by even a speck of dust: their way of living is supposed to remind men of their clumsiness and burden their conscience with this. Thus they defend themselves against the strong and ‘the law of the jungle’.</description>

What bewitched him was precisely that she seemed utterly changeable and unfathomable! He already had too much steady weather in himself! Wouldn’t she do well to feign her old character? To feign lovelessness? Isn’t that the counsel of – love? *Vivat comoedia!*6</description>

      <description>Will and willingness. – Someone took a youth to a wise man and said: ‘Look, he is being corrupted by women!’ The wise man shook his head and smiled. ‘It is men who corrupt women’, he exclaimed, ‘and the failings of women should be atoned for and set right in men – for man makes for himself the image (Bild) of woman, and woman shapes herself (bildet sich) according to this image (Bild)’.</description>

      <description>Capacity for revenge. – That someone cannot defend himself and therefore also does not want to – this is not enough to disgrace him in our eyes; but we have a low regard for anyone who has neither the capacity nor the good will for revenge – regardless of whether it is a man or a woman. Would a woman be able to hold us (or ‘enthrall’ us, as they say) if we did not consider her able under certain circumstances to wield a dagger deftly (any kind of dagger) against us?</description>

And Downs lifted his head and looked straight at the first mate and said, “That was unlawful, uncommon, criminal eavesdropping. We have no right!”
“Upon uncommon dangers!”
“Would you mutiny, sir?” said Small.
Redleigh pulled back, a horrified look on his face. “Mutiny?!”
Quell broke in. “He would … take over.”
And we answered mutely, with our own horrified faces.
Redleigh said, “Have you not just heard what is in his heart, what he intends to do?</description>

      <description>Inside the dim hall, Cardiff felt as if he had moved into a summer-cool milk shed that smelled of large canisters of cream hidden away from the sun, and iceboxes dripping their secret liquors, and bread laid out fresh on kitchen tables, and pies cooling on windowsills.
Cardiff took another step and knew he would sleep nine hours a night here and wake like a boy at dawn, excited that he was alive, and all the world beginning, morn after morn, glad for his heart in his body, and his pulse in his wrists.</description>

      <description>Christianity is called the religion of pity.—Pity stands in opposition to all the tonic passions that augment the energy of the feeling of aliveness: it is a depressant. A man loses power when he pities. Through pity that drain upon strength which suffering works is multiplied a thousandfold. Suffering is made contagious by pity; under certain circumstances it may lead to a total sacrifice of life and living energy—a loss out of all proportion to the magnitude of the cause (—the case of the death of the Nazarene).</description>

      <description>Something for the industrious. – Anyone who now wishes to make a study of moral matters opens up for himself an immense field of work. All kinds of passions have to be thought through separately, pursued separately through ages, peoples, great and small individuals; their entire reason and all their evaluations and modes of illuminating things must be revealed! So far, all that has given colour to existence still lacks a history: where could you find a history of love, of avarice, of envy, of conscience, of piety, of cruelty?</description>

      <description>“Dattatreya is unique. But then, his father was a Rishi. Each Rishi offers his own experience to the world by sending down his essence to be bom as a prophet or a saint, to guide and teach. When things on Earth come to such a pass that the continued existence of the Rishis&amp;rsquo; Lila seems threat ened, a Rishi will send down an emanation of himself to guide the errant sheep back to the fold, as Jesus tried to do.</description>

      <description>With Two Supplements
1 ‘HUMAN, All Too Human’ is the memorial of a crisis. It calls itself a book for free spirits: almost every sentence in it is the expression of a victory − with this book I liberated myself from that in my nature which did not belong to me. Idealism does not belong to me: the title says: ‘where you see ideal things, I see − human, alas all too human things!</description>

      <description>OUR GREATEST TINGLE during the Spring 1979 Bombay Race Meeting was the announcement of a blessed event: the debut in our world of Stoney&amp;rsquo;s first foal, a colt whom Vimalananda promptly named Redstone. The spring&amp;rsquo;s most unusual incident, however, occurred midseason when Vimalananda felt obliged to exercise yet another of his siddhis to deal with Behram, the husband of Shernaz and father of Arzoo. He had unexpectedly and inoppor tunely arrived in Poona from Iran just in time for Navroz, the ancient Persian New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day which many Indian Zoroastrians still celebrate.</description>

      <description>If a four-year-old boy were to sit on top of his dead grandmother, pick up his father’s japamala and begin to do japa, what sort of boy would you say he is? You would have to say he was born to do Smashan Sadhana. I have seen a boy who did that. Why, even I, when I was a child, used to build toy funeral pyres out of twigs and matchsticks; it’s an inborn tendency in someone who is meant to be an Aghori.</description>

He nodded his assent. “And this chemical composition determines what sort of sadhana is appropriate for you, what you can succeed at. There is no lack of people today who claim to have located the keys to the Vedas, and who claim that they are living a &amp;lsquo;Vedic&amp;rsquo; life, and teaching their disciples &amp;lsquo;Vedic&amp;rsquo; sadhanas.</description>

      <description>The women who master the masters. – A deep and powerful alto voice, such as one sometimes hears in the theatre, suddenly raises the curtain upon possibilities that we usually do not believe in. All at once we believe that somewhere in the world there could be women with lofty, heroic, royal souls, capable of and ready for grandiose retorts, resolutions, and sacrifices, capable of and ready for mastery over men, because in them the best of man aside from his sex has become an incarnate ideal.</description>

      <description>On female chastity. – There is something quite amazing and monstrous in the upbringing of upper-class women; indeed, maybe there is nothing more paradoxical. The whole world agrees that they should be brought up as ignorant as possible about matters erotic, and that one has to impart in their souls a deep shame in the face of such things and the most extreme impatience and flight at the merest suggestion of them.</description>

      <description>Mothers. – Animals think differently about females than humans do; they consider the female to be the productive being. There is no paternal love among them, only something like love for the children of a beloved and a getting used to them. In their children females have a satisfaction of their desire to dominate, a possession, an occupation, something that is totally intelligible to them and can be prattled with: all this taken together is motherly love – it is to be compared to the love of an artist for his work.</description>

      <description>The greatest danger. – Had there not always been a majority of men who felt the discipline of their heads – their ‘rationality’ – to be their pride, their obligation, their virtue, and who were embarrassed or ashamed by all fantasizing and debauchery of thought, being the friends of ‘healthy common sense’, humanity would have perished long ago! The greatest danger that hovered and still hovers over humanity is the outbreak of madness – that is, the outbreak of arbitrariness in feeling, seeing, and hearing; the enjoyment in the lack of discipline of the head, the joy in human unreason.</description>

      <description>What we should be grateful for. – Only artists, and especially those of the theatre, have given men eyes and ears to see and hear with some pleasure what each himself is, himself experiences, himself wants; only they have taught us to value the hero that is hidden in each of these everyday characters and taught the art of regarding oneself as a hero, from a distance and as it were simplified and transfigured – the art of ‘putting oneself on stage’ before oneself.</description>

      <description>The attraction of imperfection. – I see here a poet who, like some people, exerts a greater attraction through his imperfections than through all that reaches completion and perfection under his hand – indeed, his advantage and fame are due much more to his ultimate incapacity than to his ample strength. His work never wholly expresses what he really would like to express, what he would like to have seen: it seems as if he has had the foretaste of a vision, but never the vision itself – yet a tremendous lust for this vision remains in his soul, and it is from this that he derives his equally tremendous eloquence of desire and craving.</description>

      <description>“Mr. Redleigh, you have come to mutiny.”
The captain had granted us entrance to his quarters and he stood within, facing us, his strange white eyes seeming to stare.
“Sir,” said Redleigh. “The simple fact is—”
The captain interrupted. “Simple? The sun’s temperature is 20,000 degrees. Yet it will burn Earth. Simple? I distrust people who come with plain facts and then preach calamities. Now, Redleigh, listen. I am giving over command of this spacecraft to you.</description>

      <description>The dining room, like the porch, was the longest one he’d ever seen.
All of the summer porch people were lined up on either side of an incredible table, staring at Cardiff and Nef as they came through the door.
At the far end were two chairs waiting for them and as soon as Cardiff and Nef sat, there was a flurry of activity as utensils were raised and platters passed.</description>

      <description>It is necessary to say just whom we regard as our antagonists: theologians and all who have any theological blood in their veins—this is our whole philosophy&amp;hellip;. One must have faced that menace at close hand, better still, one must have had experience of it directly and almost succumbed to it, to realize that it is not to be taken lightly (—the alleged free-thinking of our naturalists and physiologists seems to me to be a joke—they have no passion about such things; they have not suffered—).</description>

      <description>Unconscious virtues. – All qualities of a person of which he is conscious – and especially those he supposes to be visible and plain to others also – are subject to laws of development entirely different from those qualities which are unknown or badly known to him, which conceal themselves by means of their subtlety even from the eye of a rather subtle observer and which know how to hide as if behind nothing at all.</description>

      <description>Prelude in German Rhymes*
1. Invitation
Dare to taste my fare, dear diner!
Come tomorrow it tastes finer
and day after even good!
If you still want more – I’ll make it,
from past inspiration take it,
turning food for thought to food.
2. My Happiness
Since I grew weary of the search
I taught myself to find instead.
Since cross winds caused my ship to lurch
I sail with all winds straight ahead.</description>

      <description>Thoughts about Morality as a Prejudice
I WITH this book begins my campaign against morality. Not that it smells in the slightest of gunpowder – quite other and more pleasant odours will be perceived in it, provided one has some subtlety in one’s nostrils. Neither big nor even small guns: if the effect of the book is negative, its means are all the less so, means from which the effect follows like a conclusion not like a cannon-shot.</description>

      <description>VIMALANANDA&amp;rsquo;S INTEREST IN his spiritual children&amp;rsquo; had been corrod ing for some time, for they were proving to be no more dedicated than Shan karacharya&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;sons. It waned yet further on the morning that he had a visitation from Doshi&amp;rsquo;s wife. She and Doshi had come to Poona that weekend to accompany us for some homa nearby, and were staying in the hotel room that was next door to Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s. Apparently these two, conniving per haps with some of the other children, had decided that it was time for Vima lananda to part with some of his Tantric sexual knowledge.</description>

      <description>As Joseph Campbell documents in his book The Inner Reaches of Outer Space, the force that the Tantras call Kundalini has been represented as a ser pent in many world cultures, including the Sumerian, Chinese, ancient Irish, Aztec and Greek (the caduceus). Images of Kundalini as the Serpent Power predominantly reflect Her power of possessiveness, of Maya. Indian cosmology describes seven netherworlds beneath the surface of the earth in which dwell asuras (the &amp;ldquo;selfish&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;jealous” gods) and nagas (semi-divine snake beings).</description>

      <description>Art and nature. – The Greeks (or at least the Athenians) liked to hear good speech; indeed, they had a greedy craving for it which distinguishes them more than anything else from the non-Greeks. And so they demanded even of passion on stage that it speak well, and submitted with delight to the unnaturalness of dramatic verse – after all, in nature, passion is so taciturn! So mute and bashful! Or when it finds words, so confused and irrational and a shame to itself!</description>

      <description>Esprit17 as un-Greek. – The Greeks are indescribably logical and simple in all their thought; at least in their long good age they never wearied of this, as so often do the French, who all too gladly take a little leap into the opposite and actually only endure the spirit of logic when, through a series of such small leaps into the opposite, it betrays its sociable civility, its sociable self-denial.</description>

      <description>Translations. – One can estimate the degree of an age’s historical sense from the way it makes translations and seeks to absorb past ages and books. The French of Corneille’s age19 as well as those of the Revolution seized Roman antiquity in a way we no longer dare to – thanks to our higher historical sense. And Roman antiquity itself: how violently and yet naively it laid its hand on everything good and lofty in the older Greek antiquity!</description>

This act of making speech rhythm counteracts rather than contributes to the clarity of communication, and yet it has shot up and is still shooting up all over the earth like a mockery of all useful expediency!</description>

      <description>The good and the beautiful. – Artists constantly glorify – they do nothing else – and in particular all those states and things reputed to give man the occasion for once to feel good, or great, or drunk, or merry, or well and wise. These select things and states, whose value for human happiness is considered certain and well-defined, are the artists’ objects: artists always lie in wait to discover such things and to draw them into the realm of art.</description>

That which in the last instance is good in their own garden and vineyard is not fully appreciated by them, and their love and insight are not of the same order.</description>

The very same opinions and types of proof and scrutiny that a thinker may consider a frivolity in himself to which he has, to his shame, succumbed on this or that occasion – these very same views may give an artist who encounters them and lives with them for a while the feeling that he has now become deeply serious about truth and that it is admirable that he, as an artist, has at the same time the most serious desire for the opposite of appearance.</description>

      <description>Now and formerly. – What do all our art of artworks matter if we lose that higher art, the art of festivals! Formerly, all artworks were displayed on the great festival road of humanity, as commemorations and memorials of high and happy moments. Now one uses artworks to lure poor, exhausted, and sick human beings to the side of humanity’s road of suffering for a short lascivious moment; one offers them a little intoxication and madness.</description>

      <description>Upon this theological instinct I make war: I find the tracks of it everywhere. Whoever has theological blood in his veins is shifty and dishonourable in all things. The pathetic thing that grows out of this condition is called faith: in other words, closing one’s eyes upon one’s self once for all, to avoid suffering the sight of incurable falsehood. People erect a concept of morality, of virtue, of holiness upon this false view of all things; they ground good conscience upon faulty vision; they argue that no other sort of vision has value any more, once they have made theirs sacrosanct with the names of “God,” “salvation” and “eternity.</description>

      <description>Our eruptions. – Countless things that humanity acquired in earlier stages, but so feebly and embryonically that no one could tell that they had been acquired, suddenly emerge into the light much later, perhaps after centuries; meanwhile they have become strong and ripe. Some ages seem to lack completely some talent or virtue, just as some people do: but just wait for their children and grandchildren, if you have time to wait – they bring to light the inner qualities of their grandfathers, the qualities that their grandfathers themselves did not know about.</description>

      <description>To Goethe1
The ever-enduring
is merely your parable!
God the all-blurring
your fiction unbearable&amp;hellip;
World-wheel, the turning one
spawns goals each day:
Fate – sighs the yearning one,
the fool calls it – play.
World-play, the ruling one,
blends truth and tricks: –
The eternally fooling one
blends us – in the mix!&amp;hellip;
Vogelfrei is an archaic expression used to declare someone an outlaw, literally ‘free as a bird’, and therefore not to be sheltered.</description>

      <description>I have always maintained that there are two parts of the body which move even though they have no bone to support them: the tongue and the penis (or clitoris). These organs are made to move by the ego alone. They can take you to the heights of success if they are controlled, and if they are misused — if you make just a single mistake in your sadhana — down you go, divebombing like a Stuka.</description>

      <description>Even though the chakras of the subtle body have been identified by other cultures, such as the ancient Egyptian and the Navajo, they have never been directly introduced into popular religion, for good reason. Having our Kun dalinis unawakened and our chakras closed is a form of protection; exist ence is possible for embodied beings solely because their chakras are

normally blocked. In fact, many Kundalini-generated disorders are due not to the blockage of a chakra but to the lack of blockage thereof.</description>

      <description>‘DAYBREAK’ is an affirmative book, profound but bright and benevolent. The same applies once again and in the highest degree to the gaya scienza: in practically every sentence of this book profundity and exuberance go hand in hand. A poem which expresses gratitude for the most wonderful month of January I have ever experienced – the entire book is a gift – betrays out of what a depth ‘science’ has here become gay:</description>

      <description>Lights and shadows. – Books and drafts mean different things to different thinkers: one has collected in a book the lights that he was able swiftly to steal and carry home from the rays of some insight that dawned on him; another is able to convey only the shadows, the after-images in grey and black, of that which built itself up in his soul the day before.</description>

      <description>Caution. – As is well known, Alfieri32 lied very much when he told his amazed contemporaries his life story. He lied from that despotism against himself which he also revealed in the way he created his own language and tyrannized himself into becoming a poet – he had finally found a severe form of sublimity into which he pressed his life and his memory: no doubt there was much agony in all this.</description>

      <description>Prose and poetry. – It is remarkable that the great masters of prose have almost always also been poets, be it publicly or only in secret, in the ‘closet’; and verily, one writes good prose only face to face with poetry! For this is an uninterrupted, courteous war with poetry: all its attractions depend on the fact that poetry is constantly evaded and contradicted; everything abstract wants to be presented as a prank against poetry and as if with a mocking voice; everything dry and cool is supposed to drive the lovely goddess into lovely despair; often there are rapprochements, reconciliations for a moment, and then a sudden leap back and derisive laugh; often the curtain is raised and a harsh light is let in just as the goddess is enjoying her dusks and muted colours; often the word is taken out of her mouth and sung according to a melody that makes her cover her refined ears with her refined hands – and so there are a thousand delights of this war, including defeat, of which the unpoetic, the so-called men of prose, know nothing at all – which is why they write and speak only bad prose!</description>

      <description>But then why do you write? – A: I am not one of those who think with a wet quill in hand; much less one of those who abandon themselves to their passions right before the open inkwell, sitting on their chair and staring at the paper. I am annoyed or ashamed by all writing; to me, writing is nature’s call – to speak of it even in simile is repugnant to me.</description>

      <description>Growth after death. – Those audacious little words about moral matters that Fontenelle threw out in his immortal Dialogues of the Dead37 were considered in his time to be paradoxes and games of a not wholly innocent wit; even the highest judges of taste and of the mind saw nothing more in it – indeed, maybe not even Fontenelle himself. Now something incredible transpires: these thoughts become truths! Science proves them!</description>

      <description>Chamfort.40 – That someone who knew humanity and the masses as well as Chamfort still joined the masses and did not stand aside in philosophical renunciation and defence, I can only explain as follows: one instinct in him was stronger than his wisdom and was never satisfied: his hatred of all nobility of blood; perhaps his mother’s old hatred, which was only too easy to explain and which he had sanctified through love of his mother – an instinct for revenge harking back to his boyhood, waiting for the hour to avenge his mother.</description>

      <description>Two speakers. – Of these two speakers, the one can show the full rationality of his cause only when he abandons himself to passion: this alone pumps enough blood and heat into his brain to force his lofty intellect to reveal itself. The other attempts the same thing now and then – to present his cause with the help of passion, sonorously, violently, and captivatingly – but usually with little success.</description>

      <description>On the garrulousness of writers. – There is a garrulousness of rage – frequent in Luther, also in Schopenhauer. A garrulousness due to an exceedingly large supply of conceptual formulations, as in Kant. A garrulousness due to a delight in ever-new twists of the same thing: one finds this in Montaigne. A garrulousness of spiteful natures: whoever reads the publications of our time will recall two writers here. A garrulousness from a delight in good words and forms of language: not rare in Goethe’s prose.</description>

      <description>In praise of Shakespeare. – The most beautiful thing I can say in praise of Shakespeare as a human being is this: he believed in Brutus and didn’t cast a speck of suspicion on this type of virtue! To him he devoted his best tragedy – it is still called by the wrong name46 – to him and to the most dreadful epitome of lofty morality. Independence of soul! That’s what’s at stake here!</description>

      <description>Schopenhauer’s followers. – What happens when people of a higher culture and barbarians come into contact: the lower culture usually takes on the vices, weaknesses, and excesses of the higher culture, on which basis it feels a certain attraction to that culture and finally, by way of the acquired vices and weaknesses, accepts some overflow of the valuable force of the higher culture – one can also observe this nearby and without travelling to barbarian peoples, to be sure in a form that is somewhat over-refined and intellectualized and not so easily palpable.</description>

      <description>This book might need more than one preface; and in the end there would still be room for doubting whether someone who has not experienced something similar could, by means of prefaces, be brought closer to the experiences of this book. It seems to be written in the language of the wind that brings a thaw: it contains high spirits, unrest, contradiction, and April weather, so that one is constantly reminded of winter’s nearness as well as of the triumph over winter that is coming, must come, perhaps has already come&amp;hellip;Gratitude flows forth incessantly, as if that which was most unexpected had just happened – the gratitude of a convalescent – for recovery was what was most unexpected.</description>

Chapter One
In that little town under the foothills of the western ghat in Kerala, there was just one real building which was a small temple with a tile roofing. The temple was surrounded by huts and shanties. When I arrived, there was a competition going on in the market place between two tantrics who had selected an onlooker from the crowd to be their medium.</description>

      <description>When I received from the Board of Historical Studies at Cambridge the invitation to deliver a course of lectures, specially intended for the candidates for the Indian Civil Service, I hesitated for some time, feeling extremely doubtful whether in a few public discourses I could say anything that would be of real use to them in passing their examinations. To enable young men to pass their examinations seems now to have become the chief, if not the only object of the universities; and to no class of students is it of greater importance to pass their examinations, and to pass them well, than to the candidates for the Indian Civil Service.</description>

      <description>Quell’s mind moved outside the ship to find the captain, alone.
And though I could not see, I heard, and what the captain finally said was this: “What? Nothing? All quiet, gone, spent? Is this the end? No more the hunt, the journey, and the goal? That terrifies me most: No more the goal! From here on then, what is the captain for? What does he do, if time and circumstance knock all the mountains down to one dull flat and endless plain, one long bleak winter afternoon, not even tea and simple bread to brighten it?</description>

His eyes twitched toward a front yard mailbox: Abercrombie.
Cardiff checked his list.
Abercrombie!

He jumped from the wagon, loaf in hand, when a woman’s voice called, “Thank you, Claude.”
A woman of some forty years stood at the gate to take the bread. “You, too, of course,” she said. “Mister … ?”

Definition of Protestantism: hemiplegic paralysis of Christianity—and of reason&amp;hellip;. One need only utter the words “Tübingen School” to get an understanding of what German philosophy is at bottom—a very artful form of theology&amp;hellip;.

      <description>A kind of atavism. – I prefer to understand the rare human beings of an age as suddenly appearing, late ghosts of past cultures and their powers: as atavisms of a people and its mores – that way one can really understand something about them! They now seem strange, rare, extraordinary; and whoever feels these powers in himself must nurse, defend, honor, and cultivate them against another world that resists them: and so he becomes either a great human being or a mad and eccentric one, unless he perishes too soon.</description>

Somehow I succeeded at cremating him at Bombay&amp;rsquo;s Banganga Smashan, just as eight years and three months previously he had prophesied that I would. And, just as he had promised all those years ago, his wife and children did not come to watch the pyre, for their egos still smarted from his failure to attend his daughter&amp;rsquo;s wedding.</description>

      <description>A pleasing routine developed when Vimalananda visited Poona&amp;rsquo;s Trani colony. I would come over early to help prepare lunch, and then would go off to college in the afternoon. In the evenings we would go to the stables to visit his “four-legged children,” and on race days I would accompany him into the stands at the racecourse. After returning home we would sit together until late at night while he discoursed on spiritual subjects.</description>

1 I SHALL now tell the story of Zarathustra. The basic conception of the work, the idea of eternal recurrence, the highest formula of affirmation that can possibly be attained − belongs to the August of the year 1881: it was jotted down on a piece of paper with the inscription: ‘6,000 feet beyond man and time’. I was that day walking through the woods beside the lake of Silva-plana; I stopped beside a mighty pyramidal block of stone which reared itself up not far from Surlei.</description>

Anyone who breaks new paths and has led many people onto new paths discovers with amazement how clumsy and poor those many are at expressing their gratitude; indeed, how seldom gratitude is able to express itself at all. It is as though whenever gratitude wants to speak, something gets caught in her throat so that she just clears her throat and falls silent clearing her throat.</description>

      <description>*Voltaire.*65 – Wherever there was a court, there were laws of good speech and thus also laws of style for all who wrote. The language of the court, however, is the language of the courtier, who has no area of expertise and who forbids himself convenient technical expressions even in conversation about scientific matters because they smack of areas of expertise; that is why, in countries with a courtly culture, technical expressions and everything that betrays a specialist is considered a stylistic blemish.</description>

      <description>A word to the philologists. – That there are books so valuable and regal that entire generations of scholars are well employed when, through their efforts, these books are preserved in a pure and intelligible state – philology exists to reinforce this faith again and again. It presupposes that there is no dearth of those rare human beings (even if one doesn’t see them right away) who really know how to use such valuable books – probably those who themselves write or could write such books.</description>

      <description>On German music. – Today German music is, more than any other, the music of Europe only because it alone has given expression to the transformation that Europe underwent through the Revolution: only German composers know how to lend expression to animated masses of people; how to create that enormous artificial noise that doesn’t even have to be very loud – whereas for example Italian opera knows only choruses of servants or soldiers, but not ‘people’.</description>

      <description>On the sound of the German language. – We know where the German comes from that for a few centuries has been accepted as literary German. The Germans, with their reverence for everything that came from the court, have deliberately taken the chanceries as their model in everything they had to write, such as letters, documents, wills, and so forth. To write in the style of the chanceries was to write like the courts and the government – that was something distinguished compared to the German spoken in the city in which one happened to live.</description>

      <description>The Germans as artists. – When the German really works up a passion (and not merely the usual good will to passion!), he behaves as he must, and thinks no further about his behaviour. But the truth is that his behaviour is then very clumsy and ugly, as if lacking in tact and melody, so that the spectators merely have their own feelings of embarrassment or pathos and nothing more – unless he elevates himself into that state of sublimity and rapture, of which many passions are capable.</description>

      <description>Our ultimate gratitude to art. – Had we not approved of the arts and invented this type of cult of the untrue, the insight into general untruth and mendacity that is now given to us by science – the insight into delusion and error as a condition of cognitive and sensate existence – would be utterly unbearable. Honesty would lead to nausea and suicide. But now our honesty has a counterforce that helps us avoid such consequences: art, as the good will to appearance.</description>

      <description>Let us beware. – Let us beware of thinking that the world is a living being. Where would it stretch? What would it feed on? How could it grow and procreate? After all, we know roughly what the organic is; are we then supposed to reinterpret what is inexpressibly derivative, late, rare, accidental, which we perceive only on the crust of the earth, as something essential, common, and eternal, as those people do who call the universe an organism?</description>

Quell came to attention as Downs came on deck.
“Sir, your suit is finished.” The engineer held out a suit made of some stiff black material.
“Much thanks,” said Quell. “It is a fine piece of work.”
Downs tapped on the metal carapace. “I am tempted to die and wear the damned thing myself.”
“Stick around,” said Quell. “You may get your wish.”
“Quell!” I said.
Quell stiffened, alert, turning toward me.</description>

For dead ahead there was afternoon high tea, with apricot and peach tarts and strawberry delight and coffee instead of tea and then port instead of coffee and then there was dinner, a real humdinger, that lasted until well after nine and then the inhabitants of the Egyptian View Arms headed up, one by one, to their most welcome cool summer night beds, and Cardiff sat out on the croquetless and hoopless lawn, watching Mr.</description>

      <description>A word now against Kant as a moralist. A virtue must be our invention; it must spring out of our personal need and defence. In every other case it is a source of danger. That which does not belong to our life menaces it; a virtue which has its roots in mere respect for the concept of “virtue,” as Kant would have it, is pernicious. “Virtue,” “duty,” “good for its own sake,” goodness grounded upon impersonality or a notion of universal validity—these are all chimeras, and in them one finds only an expression of the decay, the last collapse of life, the Chinese spirit of Königsberg.</description>

      <description>Consciousness (Bewußtsein)6 – Consciousness (Bewußtheit) is the latest development of the organic, and hence also its most unfinished and unrobust feature. Consciousness gives rise to countless mistakes that lead an animal or human being to perish sooner than necessary, ‘beyond destiny’, as Homer puts it.7 If the preserving alliance of the instincts were not so much more powerful, if it did not serve on the whole as a regulator, humanity would have to perish with open eyes of its misjudging and its fantasizing, of its lack of thoroughness and its incredulity – in short, of its consciousness; or rather, without the instincts, humanity would long have ceased to exist!</description>

      <description>Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future
1 THE task for the immediately following years was as clear as it could be. Now that the affirmative part of my task was done, it was the turn of the denying, the No-saying and No-doing part: the revaluation of existing values themselves, the great war – the evocation of a day of decision. Included here is the slow search for those related to me, for such as out of strength would offer me their hand for the work of destruction.</description>

      <description>Origin of knowledge. – Through immense periods of time, the intellect produced nothing but errors; some of them turned out to be useful and species-preserving; those who hit upon or inherited them fought their fight for themselves and their progeny with greater luck. Such erroneous articles of faith, which were passed on by inheritance further and further, and finally almost became part of the basic endowment of the species, are for example: that there are enduring things; that there are identical things; that there are things, kinds of material, bodies; that a thing is what it appears to be; that our will is free; that what is good for me is also good in and for itself.</description>

      <description>The origin of the logical. – What is the origin of logic in man’s head? Surely it arose out of the illogical, the realm of which must originally have been immense. But innumerable beings drew inferences in a way different from that in which we do now perished; nonetheless, they might have been closer to the truth! He, for instance, who did not know how to find ‘identity’ often enough, both with regard to nourishment and to hostile animals – that is, he who subsumed too slowly and was too cautious in subsumption – had a slighter probability of survival than he who in all cases of similarity immediately guessed that they were identical.</description>

      <description>Cause and effect. – We call it ‘explanation’, but ‘description’ is what distinguishes us from older stages of knowledge and science. We are better at describing – we explain just as little as all our predecessors. We have uncovered a diverse succession where the naive man and investigator of older cultures saw only two different things, ‘cause’ and ‘effect’, as they said; we have perfected the picture of becoming but haven’t got over, got behind the picture.</description>

      <description>Herd instinct. – Wherever we encounter a morality, we find an evaluation and ranking of human drives and actions. These evaluations and rankings are always the expression of the needs of a community and herd: that which benefits it the most – and second most, and third most – is also the highest standard of value for all individuals. With morality the individual is instructed to be a function of the herd and to ascribe value to himself only as a function.</description>

      <description>Benevolence. – Is it virtuous when a cell transforms itself into a function of a stronger cell? It has to. And is it evil when the stronger cell assimilates the weaker? It also has to; this is necessary for it, since it strives for superabundant replenishment and wants to regenerate itself. Accordingly one should make a distinction in benevolence between the drive to appropriate and the drive to submit, depending on whether it is the stronger or the weaker who experiences it.</description>

Cardiff refilled his glass.
“Never coming home. Never ever,” he whispered.
And went up to bed.

      <description>I put aside a few sceptics, the types of decency in the history of philosophy: the rest haven’t the slightest conception of intellectual integrity. They behave like women, all these great enthusiasts and prodigies—they regard “beautiful feelings” as arguments, the “heaving breast” as the bellows of divine inspiration, conviction as the criterion of truth. In the end, with “German” innocence, Kant tried to give a scientific flavour to this form of corruption, this dearth of intellectual conscience, by calling it “practical reason.</description>

      <description>A Polemic
THE three essays of which this Genealogy consists are in regard to expression, intention and art of surprise perhaps the uncanniest things that have ever been written. Dionysos is, as one knows, also the god of darkness. – Each time a beginning which is intended to mislead, cool, scientific, even ironic, intentionally foreground, intentionally keeping in suspense. Gradually an increasing disquiet; isolated flashes of lightning; very unpleasant truths becoming audible as a dull rumbling in the distance – until at last a tempo feroce is attained in which everything surges forward with tremendous tension.</description>

      <description>Health of the soul. – The popular medical formulation of morality (the originator of which is Ariston of Chios), ‘virtue is the health of the soul’,3 would, in order to be useful, have to be changed at least to read, ‘your virtue is the health of your soul’. For there is no health as such, and all attempts to define such a thing have failed miserably. Deciding what is health even for your body depends on your goal, your horizon, your powers, your impulses, your mistakes and above all on the ideals and phantasms of your soul.</description>

      <description>Life not an argument. – We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we are able to live – by positing bodies, lines, planes, causes and effects, motion and rest, form and content; without these articles of faith no one could endure living! But that does not prove them. Life is not an argument; the conditions of life might include error.</description>

      <description>Moral scepticism in Christianity. – Christianity, too, has made a great contribution to enlightenment: it taught moral scepticism in an extremely trenchant and effective way – accusing, embittering, but with untiring patience and refinement; it annihilated in every single man the faith in his ‘virtues’. It caused those great virtuous men, of whom there was no dearth in antiquity, to disappear forever from the face of the earth – those popular men who with a faith in their own perfection went about with the dignity of a toreador.</description>

      <description>Knowledge more than a means. – Even without this new passion – I mean the passion for knowledge – science would be promoted: up to now science has grown and matured without it. The good faith in science, the prejudice in its favour that rules our modern states (and formerly even the Church), is essentially based on the fact that this unconditional tendency and urge has manifested itself in science so rarely and that science is specifically regarded not as a passion but as a condition and ‘ethos’.</description>

Now, little ship, look out! Beside you is the ocean; it is true, it does not always roar, and at times it lies there like silk and gold and dreams of goodness. But there will be hours when you realize that it is infinite and that there is nothing more awesome than infinity.</description>

Did he lose his way like a child? asked another. Or is he hiding?</description>

      <description>Aftereffects of the oldest religiosity. – Every thoughtless person believes that the will alone is effective; that willing is something simple, absolutely given, underivable, and intelligible in itself. When he does something, e.g. strikes something, he is convinced that it is he who is striking, and that he did the striking because he wanted to strike. He does not even notice a problem here; the feeling of will suffices for him to assume cause and effect, but also to believe that he understands their relation.</description>

In order that they at least do not disturb, the wisdom of all founders of religions, small as well as great, has prescribed to them the formulas of prayer as a long mechanical work of the lips, combined with exertion of the memory and a same fixed posture of hands and feet and eyes!</description>

      <description>Let us not underestimate this fact: that we ourselves, we free spirits, are already a “transvaluation of all values,” a visualized declaration of war and victory against all the old concepts of “true” and “not true.” The most valuable intuitions are the last to be attained; the most valuable of all are those which determine methods. All the methods, all the principles of the scientific spirit of today, were the targets for thousands of years of the most profound contempt; if a man inclined to them he was excluded from the society of “decent” people—he passed as “an enemy of God,” as a scoffer at the truth, as one “possessed.</description>

      <description>On the doctrine of the feeling of power. – Benefiting and hurting others are ways of exercising one’s power over them – that is all one wants in such cases! We hurt those to whom we need to make our power perceptible, for pain is a much more sensitive means to that end than pleasure: pain always asks for the cause, while pleasure is inclined to stop with itself and not look back.</description>

      <description>How to Philosophize with a Hammer
1 THIS writing of fewer than 150 pages, cheerful and fateful in tone, a demon which laughs – the work of so few days I hesitate to reveal their number, is the exception among books: there exists nothing more rich in substance, more independent, more overthrowing – more wicked. If you want to get a quick idea of how everything was upsidedown before me, make a start with this writing.</description>

But martyrdom and the ascetic’s slow suicide were permitted.</description>

      <description>Pessimists as victims. – Wherever a deep dissatisfaction with existence comes to prevail, it is the aftereffects of some great dietary mistake made by a people over a long time that are coming to light. Thus the spread of Buddhism (not its origin) depended greatly on the Indians’ excessive and almost exclusive diet of rice and the general enervation resulting from it. Perhaps the modern European discontent is due to the fact that our prehistory, the entire middle ages, was given to drinking thanks to the influence of Germanic tastes on Europe: the middle ages means the alcohol poisoning of Europe.</description>

      <description>Origin of sin. – Sin, as it is now experienced wherever Christianity reigns or once reigned: sin is a Jewish feeling and a Jewish invention; and given that this is the background of all Christian morality, Christianity can be said to have aimed at ‘Judaizing’ the whole world. The extent to which this has succeeded in Europe is best brought out by how alien Greek antiquity – a world without feelings of sin – strikes our sensibility as being, despite all the good will expended by entire generations and many excellent individuals to approach and incorporate this world.</description>

      <description>The chosen people. – The Jews, who feel they are the chosen people of all peoples precisely because they are the moral genius of all peoples (owing to their ability more profoundly to despise the human being in themselves than any other people) – the Jews take a pleasure in their divine monarch and the holy which is similar to that which the French nobility took in Louis XIV. This nobility had surrendered all its power and sovereignty and had become contemptible: in order not to feel this, in order to be able to forget this, there was a need for a royal splendour, a royal authority and plenitude of power without equal to which only the nobility had access.</description>

      <description>Speaking in a parable. – A Jesus Christ was possible only in a Jewish landscape – I mean one over which the gloomy and sublime thunder clouds of the wrathful Jehovah hovered continually. Here alone was the rare and sudden piercing of a single sunbeam through the gruesome general and perpetual day-night experienced as a miracle of ‘love’, as the ray of the most undeserved ‘grace’. Only here could Christ dream of his rainbow and his heavenly ladder on which God descended to man; everywhere else good weather and sunshine were too much of a rule and everyday occurrence.</description>

      <description>Christ’s error. – The founder of Christianity thought that there was nothing from which men suffered more than their sins. That was his error – the error of one who felt himself free of sin and who lacked experience of it! Thus his soul filled itself with that wonderful fantastic compassion for a torment that was rarely a very great torment even among his people, who invented sin! But the Christians have found a way of retroactively vindicating their master and of sanctifying his error into ‘truth’.</description>

      <description>The colour of the passions. – People like St Paul have an ‘evil eye’ for the passions: they come to know only what is dirty, disfiguring, and heartbreaking about them; hence their ideal impulse seeks the annihilation of the passions, which they see totally purified in the divine. Quite unlike St Paul and the Jews, the Greeks turned their ideal impulse precisely towards the passions and loved, elevated, gilded and deified them; evidently passion made them feel not only happier but also purer and more divine than usual.</description>

      <description>We have unlearned something. We have become more modest in every way. We no longer derive man from the “spirit,” from the “godhead”; we have dropped him back among the beasts. We regard him as the strongest of the beasts because he is the craftiest; one of the results thereof is his intellectuality. On the other hand, we guard ourselves against a conceit which would assert itself even here: that man is the great second thought in the process of organic evolution.</description>

And yet it could be the same instinct, named twice: once disparaged by those who already have, in whom the instinct has somewhat calmed down and who now fear for what they ‘have’; the other time seen from the standpoint of the unsatisfied, the thirsty, and therefore glorified as ‘good’. Our love of our neighbours – is it not a craving for new property?</description>

1 IF one is to be fait to this writing one has to suffer from the destiny of music as from an open wound. – What is it I suffer from when I suffer from the destiny of music? From this: that music has been deprived of its world-transfiguring, affirmative character, that it is décadence music and no longer the flute of Dionysos… Supposing, however, that one in this way feels the cause of music to be one’s own cause, to be the history of one’s own suffering, one will find this writing full of consideration and mild beyond measure.</description>

      <description>Too oriental. – What? A god who loves men provided that they believe in him and who casts evil gazes and threats at anyone who does not believe in this love? What? A love hemmed in by conditions as the feeling of an almighty god? A love that has not even mastered the feeling of honour and roused vengefulness? How oriental this all is! ‘If I love you, what does that concern you?</description>

      <description>The greatest advantage of polytheism. – For an individual to posit his own ideal and to derive from it his own law, joys and rights – that may well have been considered hitherto to be the most outrageous of human aberrations and idolatry itself; indeed, the few who dared it always felt the need to apologize to themselves, usually as follows: ‘Not I! Not I! But a god through me!’ The wonderful art and power of creating gods – polytheism – was that through which this drive could discharge itself, purify, perfect and ennoble itself; for originally it was a base and undistinguished drive, related to stubbornness, disobedience, and envy.</description>

      <description>Religious wars. – The greatest progress of the masses up till now has been the religious war, for it proves that the mass has begun to treat concepts with respect. Religious wars start only when the finer quarrels among sects have refined common reason so that even the mob becomes subtle and takes trifles seriously, and actually considers it possible that the ‘eternal salvation of the soul’ might hinge on slight differences between concepts.</description>

      <description>Danger for vegetarians. – A diet consisting primarily of rice leads to the use of opium and narcotics, just as a diet consisting primarily of potatoes leads to the use of liquor. But its subtler effects also include ways of thinking and feeling that work narcotically. This harmonizes with the fact that the promoters of narcotic ways of thinking and feeling, like those Indian gurus, praise precisely a diet that is purely vegetarian and would like to make that a law of the masses: thus they want to call forth and increase a need that they are able to satisfy.</description>

      <description>German hopes. – Let us not forget that names of peoples are usually terms of abuse. The Tartars, for example, are literally ‘the dogs’; that is what the Chinese called them. The ‘Germans’: this originally meant ‘heathen’; that is what the Goths after their conversion named the great mass of their unbaptized kindred tribes, in accordance with their translation of the Septuagint20 in which the heathens were designated with a word that in Greek means ‘the nations’; see Ulfilas.</description>

      <description>Where reformations arise. – At the time of the great corruption of the Church, the Church in Germany was the least corrupt; that is why the Reformation occurred here, as a sign that even the beginnings of corruption were felt to be intolerable. For relatively speaking, no people has ever been more Christian than the Germans at the time of Luther; their Christian culture was ready to burst into a hundredfold splendour of blossoms – only one more night was needed, but this brought the storm that put an end to everything.</description>

      <description>The failure of reformations. – That several attempts to found new Greek religions have failed testifies to the higher culture of the Greeks even in rather early times; it indicates that even early in Greece, there must have been many diverse individuals whose diverse plights could not be disposed of with a single prescription of faith and hope. Pythagoras23 and Plato, perhaps Empedocles24 as well, and the Orphic enthusiasts25 much earlier yet, were out to found new religions; and the former two had souls and talents which were so much those of founders of religions that one cannot wonder enough at their failure; yet all they managed to found were sects.</description>

      <description>At midnight the wind blew softly in the window, whispering the curtains, shadowing the moonlight.
There, far across town, lay the cemetery, immense white teeth scattered on a meadow of fresh moon-silvered grass.
Four dozen stones dead, but not dead.
All lies, he thought.
And found himself halfway down the boarding house stairs, surrounded by the exhalations of sleeping people. There was no sound save the drip of the ice pan under the icebox in the moonlit kitchen.</description>

      <description>Under Christianity neither morality nor religion has any point of contact with actuality. It offers purely imaginary causes (“God,” “soul,” “ego,” “spirit,” “free will”—or even “unfree”), and purely imaginary effects (“sin,” “salvation,” “grace,” “punishment,” “forgiveness of sins”). Intercourse between imaginary beings (“God,” “spirits,” “souls”); an imaginary natural history (anthropocentric; a total denial of the concept of natural causes); an imaginary psychology (misunderstandings of self, misinterpretations of agreeable or disagreeable general feelings—for example, of the states of the nervus sympathicus with the help of the sign-language of religio-ethical balderdash—, “repentance,” “pangs of conscience,” “temptation by the devil,” “the presence of God”); an imaginary teleology (the “kingdom of God,” “the last judgment,” “eternal life”).</description>

      <description>From a distance. – This mountain makes the entire region it dominates attractive and significant in every way; having said this to ourselves for the hundredth time, we are so unreasonably and thankfully disposed toward it that we suppose that it, the bestower of such delight, must itself be the most delightful thing in the region – and so we climb it and are disappointed. Suddenly the mountain itself and the entire landscape around us, beneath us, seem to have lost their magic; we had forgotten that certain types of greatness, like certain types of goodness, want to be beheld only from a distance and always from below, not from above – only thus do they have an effect.</description>

      <description>1 I KNOW my fate. One day there will be associated with my name the recollection of something frightful – of a crisis like no other before on earth, of the profoundest collision of conscience, of a decision evoked against everything that until then had been believed in, demanded, sanctified. I am not a man, I am dynamite. – And with all that there is nothing in me of a founder of a religion – religions are affairs of the rabble, I have need of washing my hands after contact with religious people… I do not want ‘believers’, I think I am too malicious to believe in myself, I never speak to masses… I have a terrible fear I shall one day be pronounced holy: one will guess why I bring out this book beforehand; it is intended to prevent people from making mischief with me… I do not want to be a saint, rather even a buffoon… Perhaps I am a buffoon… And none the less, or rather not none the less – for there has hitherto been nothing more mendacious than saints – the truth speaks out of me.</description>

      <description>Towards a critique of saints. – Must one then, in order to have a virtue, want to have it in its most brutal form – the way the Christian saints wanted and needed it, as those who endured life only with the thought that the mere sight of their virtue would destroy the self-esteem of anyone who viewed it? But a virtue with such an effect I call brutal.</description>

      <description>On the origin of religion. – The metaphysical need is not the origin of religion, as Schopenhauer26 has it, but only a late offshoot of it. Under the rule of religious ideas, one has got used to the idea of ‘another world (behind, below, above)’ and feels an unpleasant emptiness and deprivation at the annihilation of religious delusions – and from this feeling grows now ‘another world’, but this time only a metaphysical and not a religious one.</description>

      <description>The greatest change. – The lighting and colours of everything have changed! We no longer fully understand how the ancients experienced what was most familiar and frequent – for example the day and waking. Because the ancients believed in dreams, waking life had a different light. The same goes for the whole of life, illuminated by a light radiated back on it from death and its significance: our ‘death’ is a completely different death.</description>

      <description>A criticism of the Christian concept of God leads inevitably to the same conclusion.—A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to its own god. In him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to survive, to its virtues—it projects its joy in itself, its feeling of power, into a being to whom one may offer thanks. He who is rich will give of his riches; a proud people need a god to whom they can make sacrifices&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Over the footbridge. – When dealing with people who are bashful about their feelings, one has to be able to dissimulate; they feel a sudden hatred towards anyone who catches them in a tender or enthusiastic or elevated feeling, as if he had seen their secrets. If one wants to do them good in such moments, one should make them laugh or utter some cold, jocular sarcasm: then their feeling freezes and they regain power over themselves.</description>

      <description>Egoism. – Egoism is the perspectival law of feeling according to which what is closest appears large and heavy, while in the distance everything decreases in size and weight.</description>

      <description>After a great victory. – The best thing about a great victory is that it takes the fear of defeat out of the victor. ‘Why not also be defeated once?’ he says to himself; ‘I’m rich enough for that now.’</description>

      <description>The seekers of rest. – I recognize the spirits who seek rest by the many dark objects with which they surround themselves: he who wants to sleep makes his room dark or crawls into a cave. – A hint to those who don’t know, but would like to know, what they actually seek most!</description>

      <description>Misanthropy and love. – One speaks of being sick of people only when one can no longer digest them and yet still has one’s stomach full of them. Misanthropy is the result of an all-too-greedy love of man and ‘cannibalism’ – but who told you to swallow men like oysters, my Prince Hamlet?</description>

The whole world is celebrating him, and pampering him; he is on everyone’s lips.’ – ‘Yes, but he has a bad ear for praise. If a friend praises him, it sounds to him as if the friend is praising himself. If an enemy praises him, it sounds to him as if the enemy wants be praised for that.</description>

      <description>Open enemies. – Courage before the enemy is one thing; it does not prevent one from being a coward and indecisive scatterbrain. That is how Napoleon judged ‘the most courageous person’ he knew: Murat.30 Which shows that open enemies are indispensable to some people if they are to rise to their own kind of virtue, manliness, and cheerfulness.</description>

      <description>Elias Culpepper leaned forward to scan Cardiff’s notepad.
“You got any more doubts, indecisions, or opinions?”
Cardiff mused over his notes. “There don’t seem to be any roaring businesses in Summerton.”
“A few mice but no buffalo.”
“No travel agencies, just a train station about to sink in the dust. Main road is mostly potholes. No one seems to leave, and very few arrive. How in Hades do you all survive?</description>

      <description>Wherever the will to power begins to decline, in whatever form, there is always an accompanying decline physiologically, a décadence. The divinity of this décadence, shorn of its masculine virtues and passions, is converted perforce into a god of the physiologically degraded, of the weak. Of course, they do not call themselves the weak; they call themselves “the good.”&amp;hellip; No hint is needed to indicate the moments in history at which the dualistic fiction of a good and an evil god first became possible.</description>

      <description>Finding a motive for one’s poverty. – There is clearly no trick that enables us to turn a poor virtue into a rich and overflowing one, but we can surely reinterpret its poverty nicely into a necessity, so that its sight no longer offends us and we no longer make reproachful faces at fate on its account. That is what the wise gardener does when he places the poor little stream in his garden in the arms of a nymph and thus finds a motive for its poverty: and who wouldn’t need nymphs as he does?</description>

In the end, however, it is irrelevant whether the herd is commanded to have one opinion or permitted to have five. Whoever deviates from the five public opinions and steps aside will always have the whole herd against him.</description>

      <description>The Christian concept of a god—the god as the patron of the sick, the god as a spinner of cobwebs, the god as a spirit—is one of the most corrupt concepts that has ever been set up in the world: it probably touches low-water mark in the ebbing evolution of the god-type. God degenerated into the contradiction of life. Instead of being its transfiguration and eternal Yea! In him war is declared on life, on nature, on the will to live!</description>

      <description>Ancient pride. – The specific hue which nobility had in the ancient world is absent in ours because the ancient slave is absent from our sensibility. A Greek of noble descent found such immense intermediate stages and such a distance between his own height and that ultimate baseness that he could barely see the slave clearly any more: not even Plato could really see him. It is different with us, accustomed as we are to the doctrine of human equality, if not also to equality itself.</description>

      <description>Sometime during the night, he sensed that he was once more alone.
He woke in a panic, at dawn, thinking, I’ve missed the train. It’s come and gone. But, no—
He heard the locomotive whistle shrieking across the sky, moaning like a funeral train as the sun rose over desert sands.
Did he or did he not hear a bag, similar to his own, catapult from a not-stopping train to bang the station platform?</description>

      <description>The fact that the strong races of northern Europe did not repudiate this Christian god does little credit to their gift for religion—and not much more to their taste. They ought to have been able to make an end of such a moribund and worn-out product of the décadence. A curse lies upon them because they were not equal to it; they made illness, decrepitude and contradiction a part of their instincts—and since then they have not managed to create any more gods.</description>

      <description>Evil. – Examine the lives of the best and the most fruitful people and peoples and ask yourselves whether a tree which is supposed to grow to a proud height could do without bad weather and storms: whether misfortune and exernal resistance, whether any kinds of hatred, jealousy, stubbornness, mistrust, hardness, greed, and violence do not belong to the favourable conditions without which any great growth even of virtue is scarcely possible?</description>

      <description>The good-natured. – What distinguishes those good-natured people whose faces radiate good will from the rest? They feel well in the presence of another person and quickly fall in love with him; consequently they wish him well, and their first judgement is: ‘I like him.’ In such people there is the following succession: the wish to appropriate (they do not scruple much over the worth of the other person), quick appropriation, delight in possession, and action for the benefit of the person possessed.</description>

For assuming that one is a person, one necessarily also has the philosophy of that person; but here there is a considerable difference.</description>

      <description>Chapter Two
When we met again, the tantra master was much more forthcoming. I was greeted with a warm embrace and invited to relax under the banyan tree. I sensed that I now belonged. In an awed voice I asked him, “What was it that I saw?”
He chuckled at my neophyte’s excitement. “So, you were impressed?” I nodded. “You saw Mohini, a demoness from the underworld. Had you known how, you could have entered a pact with her for the next cycle of Jupiter (twelve years).</description>

      <description>In my first Lecture I endeavored to remove the prejudice that everything in India is strange, and so different from the intellectual life which we are accustomed to in England, that the twenty or twenty-five years which a civil servant has to spend in the East seem often to him a kind of exile that he must bear as well as he can, but that severs him completely from all those higher pursuits by which life is made enjoyable at home.</description>

“James Edward McCoy?” Cardiff said.
“Cardiff,” said McCoy, “is that you?”
Both smiled false smiles.
“What are you doing here?” said Cardiff.
“You might have known I would follow,” said James Edward McCoy. “When you left town, I knew someone had died, and you’d gone to give him a proper burial. So I packed my bag.</description>

      <description>In my condemnation of Christianity I surely hope I do no injustice to a related religion with an even larger number of believers: I allude to Buddhism. Both are to be reckoned among the nihilistic religions—they are both décadence religions—but they are separated from each other in a very remarkable way. For the fact that he is able to compare them at all the critic of Christianity is indebted to the scholars of India.</description>

      <description>The dignity of foolishness. – A few millennia further along the course set by the last century – and everything men do will display the highest prudence: but just that way prudence will lose all its dignity. Then it will, to be sure, be necessary to be prudent, but it will also be so commonplace and vulgar that even a moderately aristocratic taste will experience this necessity as a vulgarity. And just as a tyranny of truth and science could increase esteem for the lie, a tyranny of prudence could spur a new kind of nobility.</description>

At this point, Hindu resurgence is approaching a point of inflection. There was one such turning point some years back, which significantly shifted the Overton window away from the inane secularist gibberish that followed from the state sponsored indoctrination also called Indian schooling. The indoctrination went on unchecked in the pre-internet era. With the coming of the internet, it took just a decade for truth to prevail on the emotional plane and a large number of people outgrew their conditioning and fear to start speaking freely about things that had oppressed them.</description>

      <description>Great man! – From the fact that someone is a ‘great man’ one cannot infer that he is a man; he may be just a boy, or a chameleon of all stages of life, or a bewitched little woman.</description>

      <description>A way of asking for reasons. – There is a way of asking us for our reasons that not only makes us forget our best reasons but also awakens in us a defiance and resistance towards reasons in general – a very stultifying mode of asking and a trick used by tyrannical people!</description>

      <description>“This is gonna be great,” said James Edward McCoy. “I can see it now: my byline on stories about how Summerton, Arizona, hit the rocks and sank. Johnstown flood stand aside. San Francisco earthquake, forget it. I’ll expose how the government destroyed the innocents and plowed their front lawns with salt. First the New York Times, then papers in London, Paris, Moscow, even Canada. News junkies love to read about others’ misery—here’s an entire town being strangled to death by government greed.</description>

      <description>The things necessary to Buddhism are a very mild climate, customs of great gentleness and liberality, and no militarism; moreover, it must get its start among the higher and better educated classes. Cheerfulness, quiet and the absence of desire are the chief desiderata, and they are attained. Buddhism is not a religion in which perfection is merely an object of aspiration: perfection is actually normal.—
Under Christianity the instincts of the subjugated and the oppressed come to the fore: it is only those who are at the bottom who seek their salvation in it.</description>

      <description>To the teachers of selflessness. – A person’s virtues are called good with respect to their presumed effects not on him but on us and society – the praise of virtues has always been far from ‘selfless’, far from ‘unegoistic’! For otherwise one would have had to recognize that the virtues (such as diligence, obedience, chastity, piety, justice) are mostly harmful to their possessors, being drives which dominate them all too violently and covetously and in no way let reason keep them in balance with the other drives.</description>

      <description>Cardiff led McCoy into the vast yard of motionless stones and flightless angels. McCoy peered at the markers.
“Damn. There’s plenty of names, but no dates. When did they die?”
“They didn’t,” Cardiff said softly.
“Good God, lemme look closer.”
McCoy took six steps west, four steps east, and came to …
The open grave with a coffin gaping wide, and a spade tossed to one side.
“What’s this? Funeral today?</description>

      <description>When Christianity departed from its native soil, that of the lowest orders, the underworld of the ancient world, and began seeking power among barbarian peoples, it no longer had to deal with exhausted men, but with men still inwardly savage and capable of self-torture—in brief, strong men, but bungled men. Here, unlike in the case of the Buddhists, the cause of discontent with self, suffering through self, is not merely a general sensitiveness and susceptibility to pain, but, on the contrary, an inordinate thirst for inflicting pain on others, a tendency to obtain subjective satisfaction in hostile deeds and ideas.</description>

No, no. McCoy buried himself. Slipped, fell, and shut the lid.
Cardiff walked almost backward down the middle of the street, unable to tear his gaze from the graveyard, as if expecting McCoy to appear, risen like Lazarus.
When he came to the Egyptian View Arms, he staggered up the walk and into the house, took a deep breath, and found his way to the kitchen.</description>

      <description>Buddhism, I repeat, is a hundred times more austere, more honest, more objective. It no longer has to justify its pains, its susceptibility to suffering, by interpreting these things in terms of sin—it simply says, as it simply thinks, “I suffer.” To the barbarian, however, suffering in itself is scarcely understandable: what he needs, first of all, is an explanation as to why he suffers. (His mere instinct prompts him to deny his suffering altogether, or to endure it in silence.</description>

      <description>The signs of corruption. – Consider the following signs of those states of society that are necessary from time to time and that are designated by the word ‘corruption’. As soon as corruption sets in anywhere, a colourful superstition takes over, and the previous common faith of a people becomes pale and powerless against it: for supersitition is free-spiritedness of the second rank – whoever succumbs to it selects certain forms and formulas that appeal to him and allows himself some freedom of choice.</description>

      <description>Words of comfort for a musician. – ‘Your life does not reach men’s ears; to them you live a mute life, and all the subtlety of melody, all tender resolution about following or leading, remain hidden from them. It is true: you are not coming down a main street with regimental music, but that does not give these good people the right to say your way of life lacks music. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!</description>

      <description>They were passing the graveyard.
I have committed murder, Cardiff thought.
And, impulsively, he cried, “Claude!”
Claude froze and Cardiff jumped out of the wagon and rushed into the graveyard.
Swaying over the grave, he reached down in a terrible panic to lift the lid.
McCoy was there, not dead but sleeping, having given up, and was now taking a snooze.
Exhaling, Cardiff spoke down at his terrible enemy, glad that he was alive.</description>

      <description>Here I barely touch upon the problem of the origin of Christianity. The first thing necessary to its solution is this: that Christianity is to be understood only by examining the soil from which it sprung—it is not a reaction against Jewish instincts; it is their inevitable product; it is simply one more step in the awe-inspiring logic of the Jews. In the words of the Saviour, “salvation is of the Jews.</description>

      <description>Different forms of dissatisfaction. – The weak and, as it were, feminine discontented types are those who are innovative at making life more beautiful and profound; the strong discontents – the men among them, to stick with the metaphor – are innovative at making it better and safer. The former show their weakness and femininity by gladly letting themselves be deceived from time to time and occasionally resting content with a bit of intoxication and gushing enthusiasm, though they can never be satisfied entirely and suffer from the incurability of their dissatisfaction; they are also the promoters of all who know how to procure opiates and narcotic consolations, and consequently they resent those who esteem physicians above priests – thus they assure the continuance of real distress!</description>

      <description>The history of Israel is invaluable as a typical history of an attempt to denaturize all natural values: I point to five facts which bear this out. Originally, and above all in the time of the monarchy, Israel maintained the right attitude of things, which is to say, the natural attitude. Its Jahveh was an expression of its consciousness of power, its joy in itself, its hopes for itself: to him the Jews looked for victory and salvation and through him they expected nature to give them whatever was necessary to their existence—above all, rain.</description>

      <description>Not predestined for knowledge. – There is a stupid humility that is by no means rare, and those afflicted with it are altogether unfit to become votaries of knowledge. For as soon as a person of this type perceives something striking, he turns on his heel, as it were, and says to himself, ‘You have made a mistake! Where were your senses? This cannot be the truth!’ And then, instead of looking and listening more keenly again, he runs away, as if intimidated, from the striking thing and tries to shake it from his mind as fast as possible.</description>

As long as Prometheus has pity for men and sacrifices himself for them, he is happy and great; but when he is envious of Zeus and the homage paid to him by mortals, then he suffers!</description>

      <description>My God, Cardiff thought, even the sunflowers have turned away. He could not see their faces, but he was certain they fixed him with a fiery stare.
“I’m empty,” he said at last. “I’ve told all my secrets. Now, Nef, you must give me yours.”
“Well,” she said, and began to take sandwiches out of a hamper, to cut bread and butter it and offer it to him as she spoke.</description>

      <description>The concept of god falsified; the concept of morality falsified;—but even here Jewish priest-craft did not stop. The whole history of Israel ceased to be of any value: out with it!—These priests accomplished that miracle of falsification of which a great part of the Bible is the documentary evidence; with a degree of contempt unparalleled, and in the face of all tradition and all historical reality, they translated the past of their people into religious terms, which is to say, they converted it into an idiotic mechanism of salvation, whereby all offences against Jahveh were punished and all devotion to him was rewarded.</description>

      <description>What is life? – Life – that is: continually shedding something that wants to die; Life – that is: being cruel and inexorable against anything that is growing weak and old in us, and not just in us. Life – therefore means: being devoid of respect for the dying, the wretched, the aged? Always being a murderer? And yet old Moses said: ‘Thou shalt not kill.’17</description>

      <description>Originality. – What is originality? To see something that still has no name; that still cannot be named even though it is lying right before everyone’s eyes. The way people usually are, it takes a name to make something visible at all. – Those with originality have usually been the name-givers.</description>

      <description>“And now,” said Nef.
“Now?” said Cardiff.
“I must prove that I do not wish to kill the bearer of bad news. Come.”
And she led him across the lawn where the picnic blankets still lay as after a storm, tossed and half-furled, and some few dogs had arrived with the army ants while several cats waited for the beasts to leave, and Nef walked among them and opened the front door of the Egyptian View Arms and, ducking his head, blushing, Cardiff stepped in swiftly, but she was already at the stairs and halfway up before he touched the first riser, and then they were in her tower room and he looked and saw that her vast bed had been stripped and the windows thrown open wide with their wind-tossed curtains and the town clock was striking four in the afternoon as Nef lifted her arms and a great soft bloom of sheet rose in a summer cloud over the bed and he seized his half and with her gentled it down in a field of white over the bed to cover its face.</description>

      <description>Christianity sprang from a soil so corrupt that on it everything natural, every natural value, every reality was opposed by the deepest instincts of the ruling class—it grew up as a sort of war to the death upon reality, and as such it has never been surpassed. The “holy people,” who had adopted priestly values and priestly names for all things, and who, with a terrible logical consistency, had rejected everything of the earth as “unholy,” “worldly,” “sinful”—this people put its instinct into a final formula that was logical to the point of self-annihilation: as Christianity it actually denied even the last form of reality, the “holy people,” the “chosen people,” Jewish reality itself.</description>

      <description>The renouncer. – What does the renouncer do? He strives for a higher world, he wants to fly further and higher than all affirmers – he throws away much that would encumber his flight, including some things that are not valueless, not disagreeable to him: he sacrifices it to his desire for the heights. This sacrificing, this throwing away, is now precisely what alone becomes visible in him and leads people to call him the renouncer, and thus he stands before us, shrouded in his hood as if he were the soul of a hairshirt.</description>

      <description>What is the seal of having become free’? – No longer to be ashamed before oneself.
1 Group of philosophers in the early fifth century BC who argued that the world of change was a mere appearance of an underlying unchanging being
2 The German word ‘Recht’ is usually ambiguous, meaning both ‘right’ and ‘law’. In this case it seems best to render it as ‘justice’.
3 Ariston lived in the third century BC.</description>

For it is only now that the thought of a personal providence confronts us with the most penetrating force and the best advocate, appearance, speaks for it – now that we so palpably see how everything that befalls us continually turns out for the best.</description>

      <description>He slept and he dreamed.
He was on the train, going east, and then suddenly he was in Chicago, and even more suddenly, he was in front of the Art Institute and was going up the stairs and through the corridors to stand before the great Sunday in the Park painting.
A woman was standing by the painting and she turned and it was his fiancée.
As he watched, she grew older, aging before his eyes, and she said to him, “You’ve changed.</description>

      <description>As to whether he himself was conscious of this contradiction—whether, in fact, this was the only contradiction he was cognizant of—that is quite another question. Here, for the first time, I touch upon the problem of the psychology of the Saviour.—I confess, to begin with, that there are very few books which offer me harder reading than the Gospels. My difficulties are quite different from those which enabled the learned curiosity of the German mind to achieve one of its most unforgettable triumphs.</description>

      <description>Harming with what is best in oneself. – At times our strengths propel us so far ahead that we can no longer stand our weaknesses and perish from them. We may even foresee this outcome and still will have it no other way. Thus we become hard against that within us that wants to be spared, and our greatness is also our mercilessness. Such an experience, for which we must in the end pay with our lives, is a parable for the whole effect of great human beings on others and on their age: precisely with what is best in them, with what only they can do, they destroy many who are weak, insecure, in the process of becoming, of willing, and thus they are harmful.</description>

      <description>Architecture for those who wish to pursue knowledge. – One day, and probably soon, we will need some recognition of what is missing primarily in our big cities: quiet and wide, expansive places for reflection – places with long, high-ceilinged arcades for bad or all-too-sunny weather, where no shouts or noise from carriages can penetrate and where refined manners would prohibit even priests from praying aloud: a whole complex of buildings and sites that would give expression to the sublimity of contemplation and of stepping aside.</description>

Thus Napoleon too, was unable, to his great vexation, to walk in a princely and ‘legitimate’ fashion on occasions that really demanded it, such as great coronation processions; even there, he was always just the leader of a column – proud and hasty at the same time, and very conscious of it.</description>

      <description>Preparatory human beings. – I welcome all the signs of a more virile, warlike age approaching that will above all restore honour to bravery! For it shall pave the way for a still higher age and gather the strength that the latter will need one day – the age that will carry heroism into the search for knowledge and wage wars for the sake of thoughts and their consequences. To this end we now need many preparatory brave human beings who surely cannot spring from nothingness any more than from the sand and slime of present-day civilization and urbanization: human beings who know how to be silent, lonely, determined, and satisfied and steadfast in invisible activities; human beings profoundly predisposed to look, in all things, for what must be overcome; human beings whose cheerfulness, patience, modesty, and contempt for great vanities is just as distinctive as their magnanimity in victory and patience with the small vanities of the defeated; human beings with a sharp and free judgement concerning all victors and the share of chance in every victory and glory; human beings with their own festivals, their own working days, their own periods of mourning, accustomed to command with assurance and equally prepared, when called for, to obey – in each case, equally proud, equally serving their own cause; more endangered, more fruitful, happier human beings!</description>

      <description>Faith in oneself. – Few people have faith in themselves – and of these few, some possess it as a useful blindness or partial eclipse of the mind (what would they behold if they could see the bottom of themselves!), while the rest have to acquire it. Everything good, fine, or great they do is first of all an argument against the sceptic inside them. They have to convince or persuade him, and that almost requires genius.</description>

      <description>High spirits. – It seems to me that most people simply do not believe in elevated moods, unless it be for moments or fifteen-minute intervals at most – except for those few who experience an elevated feeling over a longer period. But to be the human being of one elevated feeling, the embodiment of a single great mood, has hitherto been a mere dream and enchanting possibility; as yet, history does not offer us any certain examples of it.</description>

      <description>Get on the ships! – If one considers how an overall philosophical justification of one’s way of living and thinking affects each individual – namely, like a sun, warming, blessing, impregnating, shining especially for him; how it makes him independent of praise and blame, self-sufficient, rich, generous with happiness and good will; how it incessantly turns evil into good, brings all forces to bloom and ripen and keeps the petty, great weed of melancholy and moroseness from coming up at all – one exclaims longingly, in the end: Oh, how I wish that many such new suns would yet be created!</description>

      <description>He sat for a long while listening to the wind howl in the chimney and the rain funnels outside.
The old house creaked down into a deep swell of night then backed up and over, out of sight of land and light.
Rats practiced graffiti on the walls and spiders played harps so high that only the hairs inside his ears heard and quivered.
How much loss, how much gain? he wondered.</description>

      <description>What concerns me is the psychological type of the Saviour. This type might be depicted in the Gospels, in however mutilated a form and however much overladen with extraneous characters—that is, in spite of the Gospels; just as the figure of Francis of Assisi shows itself in his legends in spite of his legends. It is not a question of mere truthful evidence as to what he did, what he said and how he actually died; the question is, whether his type is still conceivable, whether it has been handed down to us.</description>

      <description>The add-on-liars. – When people in France started to fight the Aristotelian unities18 and others consequently also started to defend them, one could see again something that is so often apparent but that people are loath to see: one lied to oneself, inventing reasons for these laws, simply to avoid admitting that one had become used to them and would no longer have it any other way. And that is what one does, and has always done, within every prevailing morality and religion: the reasons and intents behind habits are invented only when some people start attacking the habits and asking for reasons and intents.</description>

      <description>One thing is needful. – To ‘give style’ to one’s character – a great and rare art! It is practised by those who survey all the strengths and weaknesses that their nature has to offer and then fit them into an artistic plan until each appears as art and reason and even weaknesses delight the eye. Here a great mass of second nature has been added; there a piece of first nature removed – both times through long practice and daily work at it.</description>

      <description>Genoa. – I have been looking at this city for a long time, at its villas and pleasure-gardens and the wide circumference of its inhabited heights and slopes, and in the end I must say: I see faces that belong to past generations; this region is dotted with images of bold and autocratic human beings. They have lived and wish to live on – that is what they are telling me with their houses, built and adorned to last for centuries and not for the fleeting hour: they were well disposed towards life, however badly disposed they often may have been towards themselves.</description>

      <description>To the preachers of morals. – I do not want to moralize, but to those who do, I give this advice: if you want eventually to deprive the best things and situations of all their worth, then keep talking about them the way you have been! Place them at the top of your morality and talk from morning till night about the bliss of happiness, the tranquillity of the soul, about justice and immanent retribution – the way you carry on, all these good things will finally attain a popularity and street-clamour of their own, but at the same time all the gold that was on them will have worn off through handling, and all the gold inside will have turned to lead.</description>

      <description>Our air. – We know it very well: to those who glance at science as if passing it on a walk, in the manner of women and unfortunately also many artists, the severity of its service – this inexorability in matters great and small, this swiftness in weighing, judging, and passing judgement – has something dizzying and fear-inspiring. What frightens them especially is how the hardest is demanded and the best done despite the absence of praise and awards; rather, as among soldiers, what one mostly hears is almost exclusively reproaches and sharp reprimands – for doing things well is considered the rule, and failure the exception; yet here as everywhere else, the rule has a reticent mouth.</description>

There are enough people who could well entrust themselves to their inclinations with grace and without care, but who do not for fear of the imagined ‘evil essence’ of nature!</description>

      <description>Brief habits. – I love brief habits and consider them invaluable means for getting to know many things and states down to the bottom of their sweetnesses and bitternesses; my nature is designed entirely for brief habits, even in the needs of its physical health and generally as far as I can see at all, from the lowest to the highest. I always believe this will give me lasting satisfaction – even brief habits have this faith of passion, this faith in eternity – and that I am to be envied for having found and recognized it, and now it nourishes me at noon and in the evening and spreads a deep contentment around itself and into me, so that I desire nothing else, without having to compare, despise, or hate.</description>

      <description>A firm reputation. – A firm reputation used to be a thing of utmost utility; and wherever society is still ruled by herd mentality it is still today most expedient for everyone to act as if his character and occupation are unchangeable, even if basically they are not. ‘One can depend on him; he stays the same’: wherever society is threatened this is the type of praise that means the most.</description>

Some even know that the higher human being desires and invites contradiction in order to receive a hint about his own injustice of which he is as yet unaware. But the ability to contradict, the acquired good conscience accompanying hostility towards what is familiar, traditional, hallowed – that is better yet than both those abilities, and constitutes what is really great, new, and amazing in our culture; it is the step of all steps of the liberated spirit: who knows that?</description>

      <description>– One might guess that I do not want to take my leave ungratefully from that time of severe illness whose profits I have not yet exhausted even today: I am well aware of the advantages that my erratic health gives me over all burly minds. A philosopher who has passed through many kinds of health, and keeps passing through them again and again, has passed through an equal number of philosophies; he simply cannot but translate his state every time into the most spiritual form and distance – this art of transfiguration just is philosophy.</description>

      <description>Chapter Three
After three and a half years in Kerala I was transferred back to Tamil Nadu, to work under the rather severe chief accountant of the Salem branch, Mr. S. Venkata Subrahmanian. As it is common usage for educated English-speaking Tamils to be addressed by the first initials of their names, he was known to one and all as SVS.
My two good “same-age” friends were co-workers Vaidyanathan, serious, bespectacled and a bit shy, and Shankara Subrahmania, a jolly, big-bodied chap.</description>

      <description>My first lecture was intended to remove the prejudice that India is and always must be a strange country to us, and that those who have to live there will find themselves stranded, and far away from that living stream of thoughts and interests which carries us along in England and in other countries of Europe.
My second lecture was directed against another prejudice, namely, that the people of India with whom the young civil servants will have to pass the best years of their life are a race so depraved morally, and more particularly so devoid of any regard for truth, that they must always remain strangers to us, and that any real fellowship or friendship with them is quite out of the question.</description>

as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant,
do not sleep, but let me hear from you.

      <description>At the train station, there were sunflowers out on the track. Someone had been there ahead of him and if it was Elias Culpepper, he never knew.
The train stopped this time, and he got on and as he bought a ticket from the conductor he asked, “Do you remember me?”
The man looked at his face intently, scowled, and looked again and said, “Can’t say I do.”
And the train gathered steam and chugged away from the station and Summerton, Arizona, was left behind.</description>

      <description>The instinctive hatred of reality: the consequence of an extreme susceptibility to pain and irritation—so great that merely to be “touched” becomes unendurable, for every sensation is too profound.
The instinctive exclusion of all aversion, all hostility, all bounds and distances in feeling: the consequence of an extreme susceptibility to pain and irritation—so great that it senses all resistance, all compulsion to resistance, as unbearable anguish (—that is to say, as harmful, as prohibited by the instinct of self-preservation), and regards blessedness (joy) as possible only when it is no longer necessary to offer resistance to anybody or anything, however evil or dangerous—love, as the only, as the ultimate possibility of life&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>The comedy of the famous. – Famous men who need their fame, e.g. all politicians, never choose allies and friends without ulterior motives: from one they want a piece of the splendour and reflected splendour of his virtue; from another the fear-inspiring aspects of certain dubious qualities that everyone knows him to have; from another they steal the reputation of his idleness, his lying in the sun, because it serves their own ends to appear inattentive and sluggish at times – it conceals the fact that they actually lie in wait; now they need a visionary around; now an expert; now a thinker; now a pedant, as if he were their present self; but just as quickly they don’t need them any more!</description>

      <description>Preludes to science – So you believe the sciences would have emerged and matured, if they had not been preceded by magicians, alchemists, astrologers, and witches who with their promises and false claims created a thirst, hunger, and taste for hidden and forbidden powers? Indeed, infinitely more has had to be promised than can ever be fulfilled in order that anything at all be fulfilled in the realm of knowledge. Those things which now appear to us to be preludes and exercises preparatory to science were in the past certainly not practised and felt to be any such thing.</description>

      <description>Delusion of the contemplative ones. – Higher human beings distinguish themselves from the lower by seeing and hearing, and thoughtfully seeing and hearing, immeasurably more – and just this distinguishes human beings from animals, and the higher animals from the lower. The world becomes ever fuller for someone who grows into the height of humanity; ever more baited hooks to attract his interest are cast his way; the things that stimulate him grow steadily in number, as do the kinds of things that please and displease him – the higher human being always becomes at the same time happier and unhappier.</description>

      <description>The danger of the happiest. – To have refined senses and a refined taste; to be accustomed to the exquisite and most excellent things of the spirit as one is to the proper and most usual food; to enjoy a strong, bold, audacious soul; to go through life with a calm eye and a firm step, always prepared for the most extreme situations – as for a feast and full of yearning for undiscovered worlds and seas, people, and gods; to hearken to all cheerful music as if brave men, soldiers, seafarers were perhaps seeking a short rest and merriment there – and in the deepest pleasure of the moment to be overcome by tears and the whole crimson melancholy of the happy: who would not like all of this to be his possession, his state!</description>

      <description>Two happy ones. – Truly, despite his youth, this person knows how to improvise life and amazes even the keenest observer – for he never seems to make a mistake even though he constantly plays the riskiest game. It reminds one of those masters of musical improvisation to whose hands the listener would also like to ascribe a divine infallibility even though, like every mortal, they make a mistake here and there.</description>

      <description>By doing we forgo. – Basically I abhor every morality that says: ‘Do not do this! Renounce! Overcome yourself!’ But I am well disposed towards those moralities that impel me to do something again and again from morning till evening, and to dream of it at night, and to think of nothing else than doing this well, as well as I alone can! When one lives that way, one thing after another that does not belong to such a life drops off: without hate or reluctance one sees this take its leave today and that tomorrow, like the yellow leaves that every faint wisp of wind carries off a tree.</description>

      <description>Self-control. – Those moralists who command man first and above all to gain control of himself thereby afflict him with a peculiar disease, namely, a constant irritability at all natural stirrings and inclinations and as it were a kind of itch. Whatever may henceforth push, pull, beckon, impel him from within or without will always strike this irritable one as endangering his self-control: no longer may he entrust himself to any instinct or free wing-beat; instead he stands there rigidly with a defensive posture, armed against himself, with sharp and suspicious eyes, the eternal guardian of his fortress, since he has turned himself into a fortress.</description>

      <description>Stoics and Epicureans. – The Epicurean seeks out the situation, the persons, and even the events that suit his extremely sensitive intellectual constitution; he forgoes the rest – that is, almost everything – because it would be too strong and heavy a diet. The Stoic, by contrast, trains himself to swallow stones and worms, glass shards and scorpions without nausea; he wants his stomach to be ultimately insensible to everything the chance of existence pours into him – he brings to mind the Arabian sect of the Assua that one encounters in Algiers:14 like these insensitive people, he likes to act out his insensitivity before an invited audience, which is precisely what the Epicurean gladly eschews – for he has his ‘garden’!</description>

      <description>In favour of criticism. – Something you formerly loved as a truth or a probability now strikes you as an error; you cast it off and believe your reason has made a victory. But maybe that error was as necessary for you then, when you were still another person – you are always another person – as are all your present ‘truths’, like a skin that concealed and covered many things you weren’t allowed to see yet.</description>

      <description>The history of every day. – What is the history of your every day? Consider the habits of which it consists: are they the product of innumerable little cowardices and lazinesses or of your courage and innovative reason? Different as the two cases may be, people could conceivably give you equal praise and you might actually benefit them equally either way. However, praise and benefit and respectability may be enough for those who want merely a good conscience – but not for you who scrupulously examine the inside of things and know about conscience!</description>

      <description>From the seventh solitude. – One day the wanderer slammed a door shut behind him, came to a halt, and wept. Then he said: ‘This penchant and passion for what is true, real, non-apparent, certain – how it exasperates me! Why does this gloomy and earnest oppressor follow me of all people! I want to rest, but he won’t allow it. How many things seduce me to linger? Everywhere there are Armida’s gardens16 for me.</description>

      <description>The train flew across flat corn lands, over the horizon, by the lake and to the great turbulent city next to the lake, and he was running up the steps of the museum and walking among paintings to sit before the endlessly intriguing Seurat, where the Sunday strollers stood still in an eternal park.
Now beside him sat Laura, glancing back and forth from the green park to him, stunned and questioning.</description>

      <description>I have already given my answer to the problem. The prerequisite to it is the assumption that the type of the Saviour has reached us only in a greatly distorted form. This distortion is very probable: there are many reasons why a type of that sort should not be handed down in a pure form, complete and free of additions. The milieu in which this strange figure moved must have left marks upon him, and more must have been imprinted by the history, the destiny, of the early Christian communities; the latter indeed, must have embellished the type retrospectively with characters which can be understood only as serving the purposes of war and of propaganda.</description>

      <description>Trade and nobility. – Buying and selling are common by now, like the art of reading and writing; everyone has practised it, even if he is not a tradesman, and gets more practice at this technique every day – just as formerly, in the age of a more savage humanity, everyone was a hunter and practised the technique of hunting every day. In that age, hunting was common; but eventually it became a privilege and thereby lost its everyday and common character – because it stopped being necessary and became a thing of moods and luxury.</description>

What good does it do us to live in seclusion when we don’t want to keep to ourselves what gives offence? Wouldn’t it be more advisable to live in the bustle and to do good to individuals as compensation for the sins that should and must be committed against everyone?</description>

      <description>Prophetic human beings. – You are not sensible to the fact that prophetic human beings are full of suffering; you simply think they have been granted a beautiful ‘gift’ that you yourselves probably would like to have – but I will express myself in a parable. How animals can suffer from electricity in the air and clouds! We see how certain species, for example, monkeys, have a prophetic insight about the weather (as one can observe even in Europe – and not only in zoos, but also on Gibraltar).</description>

If it weren’t, it would have perished long ago: that it hurts is no argument against it – it is its essence. In pain I hear the captain’s command: ‘Pull in the sails!’ The hardy seafarer ‘Man’ must have learned to adjust the sails in a thousand ways; otherwise he would have gone under too quickly and the ocean would have swallowed him too soon.</description>

Was my will turned against all deceptions of the senses and stalwart in warding off the fantastic?’ None of them has asked such questions.</description>

      <description>The train came out of the east and without thinking of time or place, glided slowly past a spot that was marked only by dust, wind, cacti, a scatter of leaves, and a profusion of ticket-punch confetti that celebrated on the air and settled when the train was gone.
Meanwhile, a familiar suitcase skidded to a halt on the remains of a ramshackle station platform, a few surfboards on a tide of sand, followed by a man in a wrinkled summer suit who tumbled out like an acrobat, shouting with pride when he landed, swaying but intact.</description>

      <description>I can only repeat that I set myself against all efforts to intrude the fanatic into the figure of the Saviour: the very word impérieux, used by Renan, is alone enough to annul the type. What the “glad tidings” tell us is simply that there are no more contradictions; the kingdom of heaven belongs to children; the faith that is voiced here is no more an embattled faith—it is at hand, it has been from the beginning, it is a sort of recrudescent childishness of the spirit.</description>

      <description>Undesired disciples. – ‘What can I do with these two young men!’ cried an irritated philosopher who ‘corrupted’ the youth as Socrates once had done;19 they are unwelcome students. This one can’t say ‘no’ and the other one says ‘half and half’ about everything. If they adopted my doctrine, the first would suffer too much, for my way of thinking requires a warlike soul, a desire to hurt, a delight in saying no, a hard skin; he would languish from open and internal wounds.</description>

Where can you lie down in the sun so that an abundance of well-being comes to you, too, and your existence justifies itself? Let everyone do that for himself – you seem to me to be saying – and let everyone put out of his mind generalities and worries about others and about society!</description>

      <description>New caution. – Let’s stop thinking so much about punishing, reproaching, and improving! We rarely change an individual; and should we succeed, something else may have been accomplished, unnoticed: we may have been changed through him! Let’s rather make sure our own influence on all that is to come balances and outweighs his influence! Let’s not struggle in a direct fight, which is what reproaching, punishing, and desiring to improve amount to.</description>

      <description>Parable. – Those thinkers in whom all stars move in cyclical orbits are not the deepest; he who looks into himself as into a vast space and bears galaxies within also knows how irregular galaxies are; they lead into the chaos and labyrinth of existence.</description>

      <description>In media vita.19 – No, life has not disappointed me. Rather, I find it truer, more desirable and mysterious every year – ever since the day the great liberator overcame me: the thought that life could be an experiment for the knowledge-seeker – not a duty, not a disaster, not a deception! And knowledge itself: let it be something else to others, like a bed to rest on or the way to one, or a diversion or a form of idleness; to me it is a world of dangers and victories in which heroic feelings also have their dance- and playgrounds.</description>

      <description>What belongs to greatness – Who will attain something great if he does not feel in himself the power to inflict great pain? Being able to suffer is the least; weak women and even slaves often achieve mastery at that. But not to perish of inner distress and uncertainty when one inflicts great suffering and hears the cry of this suffering – that is great; that belongs to greatness.</description>

      <description>Soul-doctors and pain. – All preachers of morals, and all theologians, share one bad habit: they all try to talk people into thinking they are in a very bad way and need some severe, final, radical cure. And since humanity has for centuries far too eagerly lent its ear to these doctrines, something of this superstition of being very badly off has finally stuck, so that they are now only too ready to sigh and find nothing good in life and make sad faces together, as if life were really quite hard to endure.</description>

      <description>Taking seriously. – For most people, the intellect is an awkward, gloomy, creaking machine that is hard to start: when they want to work with this machine and think well, they call it ‘taking the matter seriously’ – oh, how taxing good thinking must be for them! The lovely human beast seems to lose its good mood when it thinks well; it becomes ‘serious’! And ‘where laughter and gaiety are found, thinking is good for nothing’ – that is the prejudice of this serious beast against all ‘gay science’.</description>

      <description>To harm stupidity. – Surely the creed concerning the reprehensibility of egoism, preached so stubbornly and with so much conviction, has on the whole harmed egoism (to the advantage of, as I will repeat a hundred times, the herd instincts!) – above all, by depriving egoism of its good conscience and telling us to seek in it the true source of all unhappiness. ‘Your selfishness is the reason your life is miserable (Unheil)’ – that was preached for millennia and, as I said, harmed selfishness and deprived it of much spirit, much cheerfulness, much inventiveness, much beauty; it made selfishness stupid and ugly and poisoned it!</description>

      <description>Leisure and idleness. – There is something of the American Indian, something of the savagery peculiar to the Indian blood, in the way the Americans strive for gold; and their breathless haste in working – the true vice of the new world – is already starting to spread to old Europe, making it savage and covering it with a most odd mindlessness. Already one is ashamed of keeping still; long reflection almost gives people a bad conscience.</description>

      <description>It was twilight when he reached the first row of orange trees.
It was deepening twilight when he saw the familiar crowds of sunflowers in each yard and the sign, EGYPTIAN VIEW ARMS, swaying above the verandah.
The sun was almost gone as he walked up the last sidewalk, mounted the porch steps, stood before the screen door, and pressed the doorbell. It chimed quietly. A slender shadow appeared on the hall stair.</description>

      <description>In the whole psychology of the “Gospels” the concepts of guilt and punishment are lacking, and so is that of reward. “Sin,” which means anything that puts a distance between God and man, is abolished—this is precisely the “glad tidings.” Eternal bliss is not merely promised, nor is it bound up with conditions: it is conceived as the only reality—what remains consists merely of signs useful in speaking of it.</description>

      <description>Outside the lecture-room. – ‘In order to prove to you that man is fundamentally a good-natured animal, I would remind you of how credulous he has been for so long. Only now, quite late and after tremendous self-conquest, has he become a distrustful animal. Yes, man is now more evil than ever.’ I do not understand this: why should man be more distrustful and evil now? ‘Because he now has a science – needs a science.</description>

      <description>Applause. – A thinker needs no applause and clapping of hands provided he is sure of his own clapping of hands; he cannot do without that. Are there people who can dispense with that, too, and altogether with every kind of applause? I doubt it; and Tacitus, who did not slander the wise, said even of the wisest of men: quando etiam sapientibus gloriae cupido novissima excuitur23 – which for him means never.</description>

      <description>Better deaf than deafened – Formerly one wanted to be talked about; that is no longer enough, since the market has grown too large – only a shout will do. As a result, even good voices shout themselves down, and the best goods are offered by hoarse voices; without the vendors’ cry and hoarseness there is no longer any genius. That is, to be sure, a bad epoch for a thinker; he must learn how to find his own quietude even between two noises, and pretend he is deaf until he really is.</description>

      <description>What knowing means. – Non ridere, non lugere, neque detestari, sed intelligere!24 says Spinoza as simply and sublimely as is his wont. Yet in the final analysis, what is this intelligere other than the way we become sensible of the other three? A result of the different and conflicting impulses to laugh, lament, and curse? Before knowledge is possible, each of these impulses must first have presented its one-sided view of the thing or event; then comes the fight between these one-sided views, and occasionally out of it a mean, an appeasement, a concession to all three sides, a kind of justice and contract; for in virtue of justice and a contract all these impulses can assert and maintain themselves in existence and each can finally feel it is in the right vis-à-vis all the others.</description>

      <description>One must learn to love. – This happens to us in music: first one must learn to hear a figure and melody at all, to detect and distinguish it, to isolate and delimit it as a life in itself; then one needs effort and good will to stand it despite its strangeness; patience with its appearance and expression, and kindheartedness about its oddity. Finally comes a moment when we are used to it; when we expect it; when we sense that we’d miss it if it were missing; and now it continues relentlessly to compel and enchant us until we have become its humble and enraptured lovers, who no longer want anything better from the world than it and it again.</description>

      <description>Long live physics! – So, how many people know how to observe? And of these few, how many to observe themselves? ‘Everyone is farthest from himself’25 – every person who is expert at scrutinizing the inner life of others knows this to his own chagrin; and the saying, ‘Know thyself’, addressed to human beings by a god, is near to malicious.26 That self-observation is in such a bad state, however, is most clearly confirmed by the way in which nearly everyone speaks of the nature of a moral act – that quick, willing, convinced, talkative manner, with its look, its smile, its obliging eagerness!</description>

This is the beginning of something completely new and strange in history: if one gave this seed a few centuries and more, it might ultimately become a wonderful growth with an equally wonderful smell that could make our old earth more agreeable to inhabit.</description>

      <description>Vita femina.28 – Not even all knowledge and all good will suffice for seeing the ultimate beauties of a work; it requires the rarest of lucky accidents for the clouds that veil the peaks to lift for us momentarily and for the sun to shine on them. Not only must we stand in just the right spot to see this, but our own soul, too, must itself have pulled the veil from its heights and must have been in need of some external expression and parable, as if it needed a hold in order to retain control of itself.</description>

      <description>If I understand anything at all about this great symbolist, it is this: that he regarded only subjective realities as realities, as “truths”—that he saw everything else, everything natural, temporal, spatial and historical, merely as signs, as materials for parables. The concept of “the Son of God” does not connote a concrete person in history, an isolated and definite individual, but an “eternal” fact, a psychological symbol set free from the concept of time.</description>

‘This life as you now live it and have lived it

There he enjoyed his spirit and solitude, and did not tire of that for ten years.

      <description>How to understand our cheerfulness. – The greatest recent event – that ‘God is dead’; that the belief in the Christian God has become unbelievable – is already starting to cast its first shadow over Europe. To those few at least whose eyes – or the suspicion in whose eyes is strong and subtle enough for this spectacle, some kind of sun seems to have set; some old deep trust turned into doubt: to them, our world must appear more autumnal, more mistrustful, stranger, ‘older’.</description>

      <description>In what way we, too, are still pious. – In science, convictions have no right to citizenship, as one says with good reason: only when they decide to step down to the modesty of a hypothesis, a tentative experimental standpoint, a regulative fiction,1 may they be granted admission and even a certain value in the realm of knowledge – though always with the restriction that they remain under police supervision, under the police of mistrust.</description>

      <description>Morality as a problem. – The lack of personality always takes its revenge: a weakened, thin, extinguished personality, one that denies itself and its own existence, is no longer good for anything good – least of all for philosophy. ‘Selflessness’ has no value in heaven or on earth; all great problems demand great love, and only strong, round, secure minds who have a firm grip on themselves are capable of that.</description>

      <description>Our question mark. – But you do not understand this? Indeed, people will have trouble understanding us. We are searching for words, perhaps also for ears. Who are we anyway? If we simply called ourselves godless (to use an old expression), or unbelievers, or even immoralists, we would not think that these words came near to describing us: we are all three of them, at too advanced a stage for anyone to comprehend – for you to comprehend, my curious gentlemen – how it feels.</description>

      <description>Believers and their need to believe. – The extent to which one needs a faith in order to flourish, how much that is ‘firm’ and that one does not want shaken because one clings to it – that is a measure of the degree of one’s strength (or, to speak more clearly, one’s weakness). Christianity, it seems to me, is still needed by most people in old Europe even today; hence it still finds believers.</description>

      <description>On the origin of scholars. – In Europe the scholar grows out of all kinds of classes and social conditions like a plant that requires no particular kind of soil: thus he belongs, essentially and involuntarily, to the bearers of the democratic idea. But this origin betrays itself. Once one has somewhat trained one’s eye to recognize in a scholarly book, in a scientific treatise, the scholar’s intellectual idiosyncrasy – every scholar has one – and catch it in the act, one will almost always behind it come face to face with the scholar’s ‘prehistory’, his family, especially its occupations and crafts.</description>

      <description>Once again, the origin of the scholars. – To wish to preserve oneself is a sign of distress, of a limitation of the truly basic life-instinct, which aims at the expansion of power and in so doing often enough risks and sacrifices self-preservation. It is symptomatic that certain philosophers, such as the consumptive Spinoza, took and indeed had to take just the so-called self-preservation instinct to be decisive:9 – they were simply people in distress.</description>

      <description>This “bearer of glad tidings” died as he lived and taught—not to “save mankind,” but to show mankind how to live. It was a way of life that he bequeathed to man: his demeanour before the judges, before the officers, before his accusers—his demeanour on the cross. He does not resist; he does not defend his rights; he makes no effort to ward off the most extreme penalty—more, he invites it&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Heresy and witchcraft. – To think otherwise than is customary is much less the effect of a superior intellect than of strong, evil inclinations – detaching, isolating, defiant, gloating, and malicious inclinations. Heresy is the adjunct of witchcraft and surely no more harmless and least of all anything venerable. Heretics and witches are two species of evil people; what they have in common is that they also feel evil but are impelled by an unconquerable lust to harm what is prevailing (people or opinions).</description>

      <description>*In honour of the homines religiosi.*10 – The struggle against the church is certainly, among other things – for it means many things – also the struggle of the baser, meaner, more cheerful, more confiding, more superficial natures against the dominion of the graver, deeper, and more contemplative, that is, more evil and distrustful individuals who, with a long-standing suspicion about the value of existence, also brooded over their own worth: the base instinct of the people, its sensuality, its ‘good heart’, rebelled against them.</description>

      <description>In honour of the priestly type: – I think that what the people mean by wisdom (and who today is not ‘people’?) – that prudent, cowlike serenity, piety and country parson meekness which lies in the meadow and earnestly and ruminantly observes life – is also that from which precisely the philosophers have always felt the most remote, probably because they were not ‘people’ enough, not country parsons enough. They will presumably also be the last to learn to believe that the people might come to understand something of that which is most remote from them, something of the great passion of the knowledge-seeker who steadfastly lives, must live, in the thundercloud of the highest problems and the weightiest responsibilities (and thus in no way as an observer, outside, indifferent, secure, objective&amp;hellip;).</description>

Supposing that by the mischievous trick of a sorcerer, the merriest dinner party suddenly saw itself exposed and undressed; I think not only the mirth would be lost but also the strongest appetite discouraged, – it seems we Europeans are utterly unable to dispense with that masquerade called clothing.</description>

      <description>On the origin of religions. – The true invention of the religion-founders is first to establish a certain way of life and everyday customs that work as a disciplina voluntatis11 while at the same time removing boredom; and then to give just this life an interpretation that makes it appear illuminated by the highest worth, so that henceforth it becomes a good for which one fights and under certain circumstances even gives one’s life.</description>

      <description>On ‘the genius of the species’. – The problem of consciousness (or rather, of becoming conscious of something) first confronts us when we begin to realize how much we can do without it; and now we are brought to this initial realization by physiology and natural history (which have thus required two hundred years to catch up with Leibniz’s precocious suspicion).14 For we could think, feel, will, remember, and also ‘act’ in every sense of the term, and yet none of all this would have to ‘enter our consciousness’ (as one says figuratively).</description>

Nothing more than this: something unfamiliar is to be traced back to something familiar. And we philosophers – have we really meant anything more by knowledge?</description>

      <description>The extent to which things will become ever more ‘artistic’ in Europe. – Even today, in this transitional period in which so many forms of coercion have lost their power, the need to make a living still forces nearly all European men to adopt a particular role – their so-called profession. A few retain the freedom, an apparent freedom, to choose this role themselves; for most of them it is chosen.</description>

A few things are still towering; much looks decayed and uncanny, while most things are already lying on the ground: picturesque enough – where has one ever seen more beautiful ruins? – and overgrown by large and small weeds. The Church is this city of decline: we see the religious society of Christianity shaken to its lowest foundations; faith in God has collapsed; faith in the Christian-ascetic ideal is still fighting its last battle.</description>

      <description>—We free spirits—we are the first to have the necessary prerequisite to understanding what nineteen centuries have misunderstood—that instinct and passion for integrity which makes war upon the “holy lie” even more than upon all other lies&amp;hellip;. Mankind was unspeakably far from our benevolent and cautious neutrality, from that discipline of the spirit which alone makes possible the solution of such strange and subtle things: what men always sought, with shameless egoism, was their own advantage therein; they created the church out of denial of the Gospels&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Two kinds of causes that are often confused. – This seems to me to be one of my most essential steps forward: I learned to distinguish the cause of acting from the cause of acting in a certain way, in a certain direction, with a certain goal. The first kind of cause is a quantum of dammed-up energy waiting to be used somehow, for something; the second kind, by contrast, is something quite insignificant, mostly a small accident in accordance with which this quantum ‘discharges’ itself in one particular way: the match versus the powder keg.</description>

      <description>On the problem of the actor. – The problem of the actor has troubled me for a very long time; I was unsure (and still sometimes am) whether it is only from this angle that one can approach the dangerous concept of the ‘artist’ – a concept that has heretofore been treated with unpardonable generosity. Falseness with a good conscience; the delight in pretence erupting as a power that pushes aside, floods, and at times extinguishes one’s so-called ‘character’; the inner longing for a role and mask, for an appearance (Schein); an excess of capacities for all kinds of adaptation that can no longer be satisfied in the service of the nearest, most narrowly construed utility – perhaps all of this is distinctive not only of the actor?</description>

      <description>Our faith in the masculinization of Europe. – We owe it to Napoleon (and not at all to the French Revolution, which aimed at the ‘brotherhood’ of peoples and a general, blooming exchange of hearts) that a few warlike centuries, incomparable to any other in history, are likely to follow in succession – in short, that we have entered the classic age of war, of sophisticated yet popular war on the largest scale (in terms of weapons, talents, discipline); all coming ages will look back on this kind of war with envy and deep respect as something perfect, for the national movement out of which this war glory is growing is merely the countershock against Napoleon and would not exist without Napoleon.</description>

For man and woman have different conceptions of love – and it belongs to the conditions of love in each sex that neither presupposes the same feeling, the same concept of ‘love’ in the other.</description>

Like all clever masks we, too, politely prop up a chair against the door when confronted with curiosity about anything but our ‘cloak’. But there are other ways and tricks for ‘wandering amongst’, for ‘associating with’, people: for instance, as a ghost – which is highly advisable if one desires to get rid of them quickly and make them afraid.</description>

      <description>The first distinction to draw regarding artworks. – Everything that is thought, written, painted, composed, even built and sculpted, belongs either to monologue art or to art before witnesses. The second category must also include the seemingly monologue art involving faith in God, the entire lyricism of prayer; for solitude does not yet exist to the pious – this invention was first made by us, the godless. I know no deeper distinction in an artist’s entire optics than this: whether he views his budding artwork (‘himself’) from the eye of the witness, or whether he ‘has forgotten the world’, which is the essential feature of all monologue art – it is based on forgetting; it is the music of forgetting.</description>

      <description>The cynic speaks. – My objections to Wagner’s music are physiological objections: why disguise them with aesthetic formulas? My ‘fact’ is that I stop breathing easily once this music starts affecting me; that my foot immediately gets angry at it and revolts – it has a need for tempo, dance, march; it demands chiefly from music the raptures found in good walking, striding, leaping, and dancing – but doesn’t my stomach protest, too?</description>

      <description>Our coexistence. – Don’t we have to admit to ourselves, we artists, that there exists an uncanny disparity within us; that in an odd way our taste and on the other hand our creative power stand each distinct from the other; each remains the way it is by itself, and each grows by itself; I mean each of these has completely different degrees and tempi of old, young, ripe, overblown, rotten?</description>

      <description>—Our age is proud of its historical sense: how, then, could it delude itself into believing that the crude fable of the wonder-worker and Saviour constituted the beginnings of Christianity—and that everything spiritual and symbolical in it only came later? Quite to the contrary, the whole history of Christianity—from the death on the cross onward—is the history of a progressively clumsier misunderstanding of an original symbolism. With every extension of Christianity among larger and ruder masses, even less capable of grasping the principles that gave birth to it, the need arose to make it more and more vulgar and barbarous—it absorbed the teachings and rites of all the subterranean cults of the imperium Romanum, and the absurdities engendered by all sorts of sickly reasoning.</description>

      <description>Because of three errors. – One has promoted science during the last centuries partly because it was through science that one hoped best to understand God’s goodness and wisdom – the main motive in the soul of the great Englishmen (such as Newton);26 partly because one believed in the absolute usefulness of knowledge, especially in the most intimate affiliation between morality, knowledge, and happiness – the main motive in the soul of the French (such as Voltaire);27 and partly because one believed that in science one had and loved something selfless, harmless, self-sufficient, and truly innocent in which the evil drives of humanity had no part at all – the main motive in the soul of Spinoza,28who felt divine in attaining knowledge – in sum, because of three errors.</description>

      <description>What is romanticism? – It may be recalled, at least among my friends, that initially I approached the modern world with a few crude errors and over-estimations and, in any case, with hope. I understood – on the basis of who knows what personal experiences? – the philosophical pessimism of the nineteenth century as if it were a symptom of a higher force of thought, of more audacious courage, and of more victorious fullness of life than had characterized the eighteenth century, the age of Hume, Kant, Condillac,39 and the sensualists: thus, tragic insight struck me as the distinctive luxury of our culture, its most precious, noblest and most dangerous squandering; but still, in view of its over-richness, as its permitted luxury.</description>

      <description>We incomprehensible ones. – Have we ever complained about being misunderstood, misjudged, misidentified, defamed, misheard, and ignored? This is precisely our lot – oh, for a long time yet! Let’s say until 1901, to be modest – this is also our distinction; we wouldn’t honour ourselves enough if we wanted it otherwise. We are misidentified – for we ourselves keep growing, changing, shedding old hides; we still shed our skins every spring; we become increasingly younger, more future-oriented, taller, stronger; we drive our roots ever more powerfully into the depths – into evil – while at the same time embracing the heavens ever more lovingly and broadly, and absorbing their light ever more thirstily with all our sprigs and leaves.</description>

      <description>Why we are not idealists. – Formerly, philosophers feared the senses: is it possible that we have unlearned this fear all too much? Today we are all sensualists, we philosophers of the present and future, not in theory but in praxis, in practice.45 The former, however, saw the senses as trying to lure them away from their world, from the cold kingdom of ‘ideas’, to a dangerous Southern isle where they feared their philosophers’ virtues would melt away like snow in the sun.</description>

      <description>‘Science’ as prejudice. – It follows from the laws that govern rank-ordering (Rangordnung) that scholars, insofar as they belong to the intellectual middle class, are not even allowed to catch sight of the truly great problems and question marks; moreover, their courage and eyes simply don’t reach that far – and above all, the need that makes them scholars, their inner expectations and wish that things might be such and such, their fear and hope, too soon find rest and satisfaction.</description>

      <description>Our new ‘infinite’. – How far the perspectival character of existence extends, or indeed whether it has any other character; whether an existence without interpretation, without ‘sense’, doesn’t become ‘nonsense’; whether, on the other hand, all existence isn’t essentially an interpreting existence – that cannot, as would be fair, be decided even by the most industrious and extremely conscientious analysis and self-examination of the intellect; for in the course of this analysis, the human intellect cannot avoid seeing itself under its perspectival forms, and solely in these.</description>

      <description>Why we seem to be Epicureans. – We are cautious, we modern men, about ultimate convictions; our mistrust lies in wait for the enchantments and deceptions of the conscience involved in every strong faith, every unconditional Yes and No. How can this be explained? Maybe what is to be found here is largely the caution of ‘once bitten, twice shy’; of the disappointed idealist; but there is also another, superior component: the gleeful curiosity of the one who used to stand in the corner and was driven to despair by his corner and who now delights and luxuriates in the opposite of a corner, in the boundless, in ‘the free as such’.</description>

      <description>Our slow periods. – This is how all artists and people of ‘works’ feel, the motherly type: at every chapter of their lives – which is always marked by a work – they always think they’ve reached their goal; they would always patiently take death with the feeling ‘we are ripe for it’. This is not the expression of weariness – rather that of a certain autumnal sunniness and mildness that the work itself, the fact that the work has become ripe, always leaves behind in its creator.</description>

In order to hate the way one formerly hated the human being, Timonically,53 wholly, without exception, with one’s whole heart, with the whole love of hatred, one would have to renounce contempt. And how much fine joy, how much patience, how much graciousness even do we owe precisely to our contempt!</description>

      <description>—I cannot, at this place, avoid a sigh. There are days when I am visited by a feeling blacker than the blackest melancholy—contempt of man. Let me leave no doubt as to what I despise, whom I despise: it is the man of today, the man with whom I am unhappily contemporaneous. The man of today—I am suffocated by his foul breath!&amp;hellip; Toward the past, like all who understand, I am full of tolerance, which is to say, generous self-control: with gloomy caution I pass through whole millenniums of this madhouse of a world, call it “Christianity,” “Christian faith” or the “Christian church,” as you will—I take care not to hold mankind responsible for its lunacies.</description>

      <description>The explosive ones. – When one considers how the energy of young men needs to explode, one is not surprised to see them decide so unsubtly and so unselectively for this or that cause: what thrills them is the sight of the zeal surrounding a cause and, so to speak, the sight of the burning match – not the cause itself. The subtler seducers therefore know how to create in them the expectation of an explosion and to disregard justifying their cause: reasons are not the way to win over these powder kegs!</description>

      <description>‘The wanderer’ speaks. – In order to see our European morality for once as it looks from a distance, and to measure it up against other past or future moralities, one has to proceed like a wanderer who wants to know how high the towers in a town are: he leaves the town. ‘Thoughts about moral prejudices’, if they are not to be prejudices about prejudices, presuppose a position outside morality, some point beyond good and evil to which one has to rise, climb, or fly – and in the present case, at least a point beyond our good and evil, a freedom from everything ‘European’, by which I mean the sum of commanding value judgements that have become part of our flesh and blood.</description>

      <description>On the question of being understandable. – One does not only wish to be understood when one writes; one wishes just as surely not to be understood. It is by no means necessarily an objection to a book when anyone finds it incomprehensible: perhaps that was part of the author’s intention – he didn’t want to be understood by just ‘anybody’. Every nobler spirit and taste selects his audience when he wants to communicate; in selecting it, he simultaneously erects barriers against ‘the others’.</description>

Anyone whose soul thirsts to experience the whole range of previous values and aspirations, to sail around all the coasts of this ‘inland sea’ (Mittelmeer) of ideals, anyone who wants to know from the adventures of his own experience how it feels to be the discoverer or conqueror of an ideal, or to be an artist, a saint, a lawmaker, a sage, a pious man, a soothsayer, an old-style divine loner – any such person needs one thing above all – the great health, a health that one doesn’t only have, but also acquires continually and must acquire because one gives it up again and again, and must give it up!</description>

      <description>—I shall go back a bit, and tell you the authentic history of Christianity.—The very word “Christianity” is a misunderstanding—at bottom there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross. The “Gospels” died on the cross. What, from that moment onward, was called the “Gospels” was the very reverse of what he had lived: “bad tidings,” a Dysangelium.[14] It is an error amounting to nonsensicality to see in “faith,” and particularly in faith in salvation through Christ, the distinguishing mark of the Christian: only the Christian way of life, the life lived by him who died on the cross, is Christian&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Finally, lest what is most important remain unsaid: from such abysses, from such severe illness, also from the illness of severe suspicion, one returns newborn, having shed one’s skin, more ticklish and malicious, with a more delicate taste for joy, with a more tender tongue for all good things, with merrier senses, joyful with a more dangerous second innocence, more childlike, and at the same time a hundred times subtler than one had ever been before.</description>

      <description>It may be quite true that controversy often does more harm than good, that it encourages the worst of all talents, that of plausibility, not to say dishonesty, and generally leaves the world at large worse confounded than it was before. It has been said that no clever lawyer would shrink from taking a brief to prove that the earth forms the centre of the world, and, with all respect for English juries, it is not impossible that even in our days he might gain a verdict against Galileo.</description>

HORATIO	I think it lacks of twelve.
HAMLET	No, it is struck.
HORATIO	Indeed? I heard it not:
then it draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

      <description>The Self in the Mirror
Chapter Four
The Chandogya Upanishad relates how Indra, king of the devas, and Virochana, king of the demons, both became students of the science of self-realization under Brahma. Brahma, to test them first, told them that the self was what they saw when they looked into a mirror or a pan of water. Virochana believed and went back to become a guru, teaching this to the other demons, who also believed; but Indra had second thoughts and returned to receive the true knowledge of the self as soul.</description>

      <description>—The fate of the Gospels was decided by death—it hung on the “cross.”&amp;hellip; It was only death, that unexpected and shameful death; it was only the cross, which was usually reserved for the canaille only—it was only this appalling paradox which brought the disciples face to face with the real riddle: “Who was it? what was it?”—The feeling of dismay, of profound affront and injury; the suspicion that such a death might involve a refutation of their cause; the terrible question, “Why just in this way?</description>

      <description>On the lack of noble style. – Soldiers and leaders still have a far higher relation to one another than do workers and employers. So far at least, all cultures with a military basis are still high above so-called industrial culture: the latter in its present form is altogether the most vulgar form of existence that has ever been. Here it is simply the law of need operating: one wants to live and has to sell oneself, but one despises those who exploit this need and buy the worker.</description>

      <description>—And from that time onward an absurd problem offered itself: “how could God allow it!” To which the deranged reason of the little community formulated an answer that was terrifying in its absurdity: God gave his son as a sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. At once there was an end of the gospels! Sacrifice for sin, and in its most obnoxious and barbarous form: sacrifice of the innocent for the sins of the guilty!</description>

      <description>Against remorse. – The thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions, as seeking explanations of something: to him, success and failure are primarily answers. To be vexed or even to feel remorse because something goes wrong – he leaves that to those who act because they were ordered to do so and who expect a beating when his gracious lordship is not pleased with the result.</description>

      <description>One now begins to see just what it was that came to an end with the death on the cross: a new and thoroughly original effort to found a Buddhistic peace movement, and so establish happiness on earth—real, not merely promised. For this remains—as I have already pointed out—the essential difference between the two religions of décadence: Buddhism promises nothing, but actually fulfils; Christianity promises everything, but fulfils nothing.—Hard upon the heels of the “glad tidings” came the worst imaginable: those of Paul.</description>

      <description>Work and boredom. – Seeking work for the sake of wages – in this, nearly all people in civilized countries are alike; to all of them, work is just a means and not itself the end, which is why they are unrefined in their choice of work, provided it yields an ample reward. Now there are rare individuals who would rather perish than work without taking pleasure in their work: they are choosy, hard to please, and have no use for ample rewards if the work is not itself the reward of rewards.</description>

      <description>When the centre of gravity of life is placed, not in life itself, but in “the beyond”—in nothingness—then one has taken away its centre of gravity altogether. The vast lie of personal immortality destroys all reason, all natural instinct—henceforth, everything in the instincts that is beneficial, that fosters life and that safeguards the future is a cause of suspicion. So to live that life no longer has any meaning: this is now the “meaning” of life&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>What the laws betray. – It is a grave error to study a people’s penal code as if it were an expression of its character; the laws do not betray what a people is but rather what appears to it as foreign, strange, uncanny, outlandish. The laws concern the exceptions to the morality of custom (Sittlichkeit der Sitte)31, and the severest punishments are for things that accord with the customs of the neighbouring people.</description>

      <description>—The gospels are invaluable as evidence of the corruption that was already persistent within the primitive community. That which Paul, with the cynical logic of a rabbi, later developed to a conclusion was at bottom merely a process of decay that had begun with the death of the Saviour.—These gospels cannot be read too carefully; difficulties lurk behind every word. I confess—I hope it will not be held against me—that it is precisely for this reason that they offer first-rate joy to a psychologist—as the opposite of all merely naïve corruption, as refinement par excellence, as an artistic triumph in psychological corruption.</description>

      <description>The supposed motives. – Important as it may be to know the motives from which humanity has acted so far, it might be even more essential to know the belief people had in this or that motive, i.e. what humanity has imagined and told itself to be the real lever of its conduct so far. For people’s inner happiness and misery has come to them depending on their belief in this or that motive – not through the actual motives.</description>

“And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city” (Markvi, 11)—How evangelical!</description>

      <description>Epicurus.34 – Yes, I am proud to experience Epicurus’ character in a way unlike perhaps anyone else and to enjoy, in everything I hear and read of him, the happiness of the afternoon of antiquity: I see his eye gaze at a wide whitish sea, across shoreline rocks bathed in the sun, as large and small creatures play in its light, secure and calm like the light and his eye itself.</description>

One would as little choose “early Christians” for companions as Polish Jews: not that one need seek out an objection to them&amp;hellip;. Neither has a pleasant smell.—I have searched the New Testament in vain for a single sympathetic touch; nothing is there that is free, kindly, open-hearted or upright.</description>

      <description>Our amazement. – It is a deep and fundamental stroke of luck that science discovers things that stand up under examination and that furnish the basis, again and again, for further discoveries – after all, it could be otherwise! Indeed, we are so convinced of the uncertainty and the fantastical quality of our judgements and of the eternal change of human laws and concepts that it actually amazes us how well the results of science stand up!</description>

      <description>—Has any one ever clearly understood the celebrated story at the beginning of the Bible—of God’s mortal terror of science?&amp;hellip; No one, in fact, has understood it. This priest-book par excellence opens, as is fitting, with the great inner difficulty of the priest: he faces only one great danger; ergo, “God” faces only one great danger.—
The old God, wholly “spirit,” wholly the high-priest, wholly perfect, is promenading his garden: he is bored and trying to kill time.</description>

      <description>Knowledge of distress. – Perhaps nothing separates human beings or ages from each other more than the different degrees of their knowledge of distress – distress of the soul as well as of the body. Regarding the latter we moderns may well, in spite of our frailties and fragilities, be bunglers and dreamers owing to lack of ample first-hand experience, compared with an age of fear, the longest of all ages, when individuals had to protect themselves against violence and to that end had themselves to become men of violence.</description>

      <description>—I have been understood. At the opening of the Bible there is the whole psychology of the priest.—The priest knows of only one great danger: that is science—the sound comprehension of cause and effect. But science flourishes, on the whole, only under favourable conditions—a man must have time, he must have an overflowing intellect, in order to “know.”&amp;hellip; “Therefore, man must be made unhappy,”—this has been, in all ages, the logic of the priest.</description>

      <description>Magnanimity and related things. – Those paradoxical phenomena, like the sudden coldness in the behaviour of the emotional person, or the humour of the melancholy person, or above all magnanimity as a sudden renunciation of revenge or a satisfaction of envy, appear in people who have a powerful inner centrifugal force, in people of sudden satiety and sudden nausea. Their satisfactions are so quick and strong that they are immediately followed by weariness and aversion and a flight into the opposite taste: in this opposite, the cramp of feeling is resolved – in one person by sudden cold, in another by laughter, in a third by tears and self-sacrifice.</description>

These stories are biographical narrations by the author, written down around 20 years ago. This was originally meant to be published as a book, but after completing the first eight chapters, the author chose not to continue, and thus we are left with the stories in their present incomplete form. Most of these stories took place around 1970. The areas discussed in these stories have changed greatly in the last 40 years and may not match what we see today.</description>

      <description>Although there is hardly any department of learning which has not received new light and new life from the ancient literature of India, yet nowhere is the light that comes to us from India so important, so novel, and so rich as in the study of religion and mythology. It is to this subject therefore that I mean to devote the remaining lectures of this course. I do so, partly because I feel myself most at home in that ancient world of Vedic literature in which the germs of Aryan religion have to be studied, partly because I believe that for a proper understanding of the deepest convictions, or, if you like, the strongest prejudices of the modern Hindus, nothing is so useful as a knowledge of the Veda.</description>

My voice reaches even the deaf.—It appears, unless I have been incorrectly informed, that there prevails among Christians a sort of criterion of truth that is called “proof by power.</description>

What is he really afraid of? Growing solitary! This is the argument that refutes even the best arguments for a person or a cause.</description>

      <description>The fact that faith, under certain circumstances, may work for blessedness, but that this blessedness produced by an idée fixe by no means makes the idea itself true, and the fact that faith actually moves no mountains, but instead raises them up where there were none before: all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through a lunatic asylum. Not, of course, to a priest: for his instincts prompt him to the lie that sickness is not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic asylums.</description>

      <description>Christianity also stands in opposition to all intellectual well-being,—sick reasoning is the only sort that it can use as Christian reasoning; it takes the side of everything that is idiotic; it pronounces a curse upon “intellect,” upon the superbia of the healthy intellect. Since sickness is inherent in Christianity, it follows that the typically Christian state of “faith” must be a form of sickness too, and that all straight, straightforward and scientific paths to knowledge must be banned by the church as forbidden ways.</description>

      <description>—It is so little true that martyrs offer any support to the truth of a cause that I am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything to do with the truth at all. In the very tone in which a martyr flings what he fancies to be true at the head of the world there appears so low a grade of intellectual honesty and such insensibility to the problem of “truth,” that it is never necessary to refute him.</description>

      <description>Where the good begins. – At the point where the poor power of the eye is no longer able to see the evil drive as such, owing to its increasing subtlety, man posits the realm of goodness; and the feeling of now having stepped into the land of goodness excites all those impulses that had been threatened and limited by the evil drive, such as the feeling of security, of comfort, of benevolence.</description>

      <description>Do not let yourself be deceived: great intellects are sceptical. Zarathustra is a sceptic. The strength, the freedom which proceed from intellectual power, from a superabundance of intellectual power, manifest themselves as scepticism. Men of fixed convictions do not count when it comes to determining what is fundamental in values and lack of values. Men of convictions are prisoners. They do not see far enough, they do not see what is below them: whereas a man who would talk to any purpose about value and non-value must be able to see five hundred convictions beneath him—and behind him&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>The consciousness of appearance. – How wonderful and new and yet how fearful and ironic my new insight makes me feel towards all of existence! I have discovered for myself that the ancient humanity and animality, indeed the whole prehistory and past of all sentient being, continues within me to fabulate, to love, to hate, and to infer – I suddenly awoke in the middle of this dream, but only to the consciousness that I am dreaming and that I must go on dreaming lest I perish – as the sleepwalker has to go on dreaming in order to avoid falling down.</description>

      <description>—One step further in the psychology of conviction, of “faith.” It is now a good while since I first proposed for consideration the question whether convictions are not even more dangerous enemies to truth than lies. (“Human, All-Too-Human,” I, aphorism 483.)[27] This time I desire to put the question definitely: is there any actual difference between a lie and a conviction?—All the world believes that there is; but what is not believed by all the world!</description>

      <description>The ultimate noblemindedness. – So what makes a person ‘noble’? Certainly not making sacrifices; even those burning with lust make sacrifices. Certainly not following some passion, for there are contemptible passions. Certainly not that one does something for others without selfishness: perhaps no one is more consistently selfish than the noble one. – Rather, the passion that overcomes the noble one is a singularity, and he fails to realize this: the use of a rare and singular standard and almost a madness; the feeling of heat in things that feel cold to everyone else; a hitting upon values for which the scale has not yet been invented; a sacrifice on altars made for an unknown god; a courage without any desire for honours; a self-sufficiency that overflows and communicates to men and things.</description>

      <description>—In the last analysis it comes to this: what is the end of lying? The fact that, in Christianity, “holy” ends are not visible is my objection to the means it employs. Only bad ends appear: the poisoning, the calumniation, the denial of life, the despising of the body, the degradation and self-contamination of man by the concept of sin—therefore, its means are also bad.—I have a contrary feeling when I read the Code of Manu, an incomparably more intellectual and superior work, which it would be a sin against the intelligence to so much as name in the same breath with the Bible.</description>

      <description>The desire for suffering. – When I think of the desire to do something, how it continually tickles and goads the millions of young Europeans who cannot endure boredom and themselves, I realize that they must have a yearning to suffer something in order to make their suffering a likely reason for action, for deeds. Neediness is needed! Hence the clamour of the politicians; hence the many false, fictitious, exaggerated ‘emergencies’ of all kinds and the blind readiness to believe in them.</description>

      <description>One catches the unholiness of Christian means in flagranti by the simple process of putting the ends sought by Christianity beside the ends sought by the Code of Manu—by putting these enormously antithetical ends under a strong light. The critic of Christianity cannot evade the necessity of making Christianity contemptible.—A book of laws such as the Code of Manu has the same origin as every other good law-book: it epitomizes the experience, the sagacity and the ethical experimentation of long centuries; it brings things to a conclusion; it no longer creates.</description>

      <description>In point of fact, the end for which one lies makes a great difference: whether one preserves thereby or destroys. There is a perfect likeness between Christian and anarchist: their object, their instinct, points only toward destruction. One need only turn to history for a proof of this: there it appears with appalling distinctness. We have just studied a code of religious legislation whose object it was to convert the conditions which cause life to flourish into an “eternal” social organization,—Christianity found its mission in putting an end to such an organization, because life flourished under it.</description>

      <description>The whole labour of the ancient world gone for naught: I have no word to describe the feelings that such an enormity arouses in me.—And, considering the fact that its labour was merely preparatory, that with adamantine self-consciousness it laid only the foundations for a work to go on for thousands of years, the whole meaning of antiquity disappears!&amp;hellip; To what end the Greeks? to what end the Romans?—All the prerequisites to a learned culture, all the methods of science, were already there; man had already perfected the great and incomparable art of reading profitably—that first necessity to the tradition of culture, the unity of the sciences; the natural sciences, in alliance with mathematics and mechanics, were on the right road,—the sense of fact, the last and more valuable of all the senses, had its schools, and its traditions were already centuries old!</description>

      <description>The next important phenomenon of nature which was represented in the Veda as a terrestrial deity is Fire, in Sanskrit Agni, in Latin ignis. In the worship which is paid to the Fire and in the high praises bestowed on Agni we can clearly perceive the traces of a period in the history of man in which not only the most essential comforts of life, but life itself, depended on the knowledge of producing fire.</description>

      <description>Christianity destroyed for us the whole harvest of ancient civilization, and later it also destroyed for us the whole harvest of Mohammedan civilization. The wonderful culture of the Moors in Spain, which was fundamentally nearer to us and appealed more to our senses and tastes than that of Rome and Greece, was trampled down (—I do not say by what sort of feet—) Why? Because it had to thank noble and manly instincts for its origin—because it said yes to life, even to the rare and refined luxuriousness of Moorish life!</description>

      <description>Here it becomes necessary to call up a memory that must be a hundred times more painful to Germans. The Germans have destroyed for Europe the last great harvest of civilization that Europe was ever to reap—the Renaissance. Is it understood at last, will it ever be understood, what the Renaissance was? The transvaluation of Christian values,—an attempt with all available means, all instincts and all the resources of genius to bring about a triumph of the opposite values, the more noble values&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>—With this I come to a conclusion and pronounce my judgment. I condemn Christianity; I bring against the Christian church the most terrible of all the accusations that an accuser has ever had in his mouth. It is, to me, the greatest of all imaginable corruptions; it seeks to work the ultimate corruption, the worst possible corruption. The Christian church has left nothing untouched by its depravity; it has turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and every integrity into baseness of soul.</description>

      <description>With and Against Sai Baba
Chapter Seven
The first welcome I got upon my arrival at Sai Baba’s ashram was from a large group of ragged beggars sitting outside the front gate. Past them, flocks of well-off people crowded into the compound; that meant Sai Baba was here now. I viewed this scene with decidedly mixed feelings.
“He is supposed to be God”, I considered, “and his followers say he has the power to remove misfortune, disease and poverty – so why are these beggars loitering here just outside his own house?</description>

Classical scholars naturally ask what is the date of our oldest MSS.</description>

Chapter Eight
A day or so later I asked my friend to take me around the village. We went to the Chitravati river, but since it was the dry season there was no water, just a sand channel.
On a rocky mound near the riverbed stood a tamarind tree from which Sai Baba is said to have magically plucked mangos and other fruits during his youth.</description>

in the agonies and pangs of each other,
that you can hear without your ears,
not because my words are significant,
but because they mean something to me.</description>

For I am the altar bird.
O time-eater,
I have seen you at the edge,
Of being and non-being,
Always empty and full.+++(5)+++
For long ago,
I have lost passion for both,
To be and not to be,
For I am the altar bird.</description>

Ambushed
During a military training course in Mhow, India, the 1962 war with China broke out. My course was cancelled, and everyone returned to their units. However, I received special orders to stay put and await further instructions. Two days later, my posting to Jammu and Kashmir arrived – with immediate reporting required.
Having driven my car to Mhow, I had no choice but to take it back to Punjab, leave it there, and then travel on to J&amp;amp;K.</description>

      <description>I was told not to walk on grass,
or move rocks,
for they also had the right to be the way they were.
for my presence should not shadow their being.
I do not know,
how to come out of silence,
for words have been poisoned the mouths that once chanted mantras.
I was told,
I had the spells to heal the world.
this must be another world.

Assuming the dark body of Apara,
Hidden in the dark,
With disheveled deep dark hair.

Stop this hide and seek game,
You lack the skills to hide yourself,
As your eyes,
like the lakes filled with love,
Shine like the moon and the sun,
Revealing all the realms.

As paradox is part of our being.
It is in the dark that we see the fire-flies glow,
Every drop counts in the desert.
When one darkness leads to another,
And death to another death,
And the night unfolds into a nightmare.
Hope is our company to shatter the chain.</description>

Men are targets of Love J_had as much as women are! A colleague’s younger brother worked in fashion industry. Let’s call him Ashish. He worked with a European brand making denim. There he met a young woman- let’s call her Shaheen.
Shaheen came across as liberal Mz. Loved Gujarati food which Ashish’s baa sent for him. Slowly she found place in his circle. They were seen together. The family was not conservative &amp;amp; thought this was merely a casual liking, they were sure Ashish would not go beyond friendship.</description>

Drown the politics, please, not our young people
You might know of Nachiketa as the brave boy who impressed Yama, the god of death, with his persistence in his pursuit of the truth. So here is the story of Ashtavakra, who, as a young man, impressed scores of scholars with his wisdom and his quest for justice.
The rapid closing down of multiple illegal coaching centres in the basements of New Delhi after students lost their lives in a flooding incident is too little, too late.</description>

With the election results now out, and all the politicians of competing formations scrambling to present a united front, it is time to think about how the exit polls were so wildly off-mark. All the political analysts are welcome to think about why the exit polls were misleading, and why the BJP’s campaign backfired &amp;ndash; after all, hindsight is 20-20.</description>

      <description>#bhakti in #carnaticmusic, is it optional or mandatory? Are they intertwined? Many scholars have debated in the past, and in the present as well. Ofcourse, I surely do not want to answer to comments like &amp;lsquo;stick to your upanyasam&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;ignorance advertisements&amp;rsquo;. Any retorts will only sideline the topic of discussion to settle personal scores. I surely don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that. Let us focus on #carnaticmusic part alone.
(1) Vedas have inbuilt swaras, but these swaras don&amp;rsquo;t touch all the octaves that music in the current form does.</description>

My answer is, NO. As far as I can tell, they were not at all concerned about those issues.

[Brahmachari Sivarama Sarma was once professor of Chemical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. He joined the Indian Administrative Service in the Nehru administration as Chief Engineer in the Sindhri Fertilizer Factory and resigned the job when Nehru pressured him to go to Russia.

he forgot to give the bull and the camel their balls.
When the bull came to demand his balls
the Buddha had to make some out of left over scraps,
and gave him a pair of a sort.
This is why they look as if they have been patched together.
Then the camel came to get his balls,
and was offered some small left-over ones.</description>

Grew just a single wing.
Could neither crawl nor fly.
The nestling,
Flopped her wings,
Peeped outside of the tiny nest,
And snuggled back.
The gypsy,
Gave him the ultimatum,
That she would leave him,
And kissed him deep.</description>

Why torment this heart,
As you own all its beats,
And ask me,
The secrecy of mudrā,
The complexity of maṇḍala,
The rhythms of mantra.
Why speak through me,
As you can enlighten all hearts.
Let this speck of dust,
Stuck somewhere in thy feet,
Be free of this world,
For the darkness has gone too long,
And the fire has been stolen,
Let me see thy face,</description>

Chaturagiri: The Abode of Siddhas
It was past mid-day when I reached the small temple dedicated to the guardian deity of the hills. He is Karuppusamy sporting a long moustache, his stretched right hand holding a sword and body decked with ornaments. The journey was tiring and I had trekked over five hours from the base camp. A half an hour climb lay ahead to the top of the hill.</description>

      <description>Metacognition in animals Do animals and birds have meta-cognition? We can all agree that animals and birds are conscious, are capable of cognizing, but how can you evaluate your own mental states and repeat the acts that you think are causal in producing the mental state of pleasure in absence of metacognition? Playing for fun is not uncommon among animals or birds. But these also demonstrate mimicry, particularly copying human actions.</description>

They were out there,
In a humid Weimar summer,
Catching a breath,
In between conference panels.
She had a stash but he was out,
They shared the smoke and laughed,
And they loved and kissed,
And made a vow,
Of every moment,
And in between,
To not ever be apart,
When the cigarette was gone,
And the break was over,
They left to not see each other again.+++(4)+++</description>

Souls do not depart,
Only their ways.+++(4)+++
When shadows devour the face,
Laughter lingers,
Like a distant echo.
Picking up a few pieces,
Of the looks or the smiles,
From the shores of the vanishing point,
And failing to assemble an image,
Enlivens half-memories,
Of half-kindled love,
Of half-walked journey,
Touching the heart-core,
With a sweet agony.
Only the ways depart,
And faces vanish,
But tears linger with heartbeats.</description>

I remember asking my father after watching Ramlila twice: but they already killed Ravana last year and why did they kill him again? And my father said: you, son, have to kill Ravana again and again till the end of time. I simply failed to comprehend his statement and even forgot about this conversation. After five decades, I came to realize its depth and fathom meaning of repeated death of Ravana.</description>

I wake up sometimes,
With my feet pulsating with thrill,
Of jumping through the fields of Thopal.
Some childhood memories stick by,
Glued to our body, mingled with the soul.
Chasing after the kites,
Rolling down the fields,
Gliding along paper planes,
Jumping in the cold waters of Thopal.
It feels as if the red dust from the slopes,
Is still stuck to my body.
And the nameless shadows,</description>

ANNIVERSARY DISCOURSE, BY THE PRESIDENT.
IN the former discourses, which I had the honour of addressing to you, Gentlemen, on the institution and objects of our Society, I confined myself purposely to general topicks; giving in the first a distant proSpect of the vast career, on which we were entering, and, in the second, exhibiting a more diffuse, but still superficial, sketch of the various discoveries in History, Science, and Art, which we might justly expect from our inquiries into the literature of Asia.</description>

The new doctor woke up with a start and looked outside his window to see the fog covered mountains. Arun had not even spent a few months sitting back in Dehradun when he had been posted to Joshimath district. He had recently joined the state medical services, and despite his parent&amp;rsquo;s remonstrations, he had wanted to serve in the state far flung, rural areas. The state health services had only just launched a small scheme, where doctors could serve for short periods in difficult to reach areas, adn then return to their private practices.</description>

There was this Medical Officer, who was posted to glacier region. It was one of those snowy, dark, cold nights, and the Doctor Saab (as army and Paramilitary forces call their medical officers), was sitting in his tent.</description>

      <description>When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me ― it still sometimes happens ― and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife.
They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions.</description>

      <description>I say - let this be the last one,
Each time,
I say farewell to the sun and the breeze,
Something sprouts from deep within,
Each time something pulsates within.
No more I say and I still breathe,
No more I say and I still laugh,
I can never not be.</description>

      <description>The last resonance,
The last echo,
I only got a glimpse of some shadows,
A minute before the sunset,
A moment before emptiness.
Some sweet memories erupt,
Mixed with some tears,
Before all forms vanish,
I envisage,
And savor the last bits of echos,
Relish the last glimpse shadows.
I ask time,
To freeze for me for a bit,
I ask the sun,
To slow down for a bit,
All in vain,</description>

      <description>I had the great misfortune of being a witness in an open and shut civil suit in a Delhi court. The case was filed in Apr 2019 and the judge had it entirely figured out in the first two hearings which were done by June. It&amp;rsquo;s been over 2 years since. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of the number of hearings now &amp;amp; there is absolutely zero progress. Luckily the complainant can afford to pay the lawyer just for marking attendance.</description>

I was 20 years old when I was sent to erase a man from existence and became haunted by him. I was going to college in Texas at the time and a group of us were contacted about a service project. The State needed a handful of young volunteers over the course of a Sunday afternoon and I was one of about ten that agreed to help.We were asked to go to the home of an elderly gentleman that had recently died and help sort his belongings.</description>

      <description>A story of Army Ethos
The desert wind whipped around Naya Chor, a lonely outpost in the vast Sindh Desert. Inside the spartan office, Captain Aditya Singh, the Unit Adjutant, chuckled as the phone buzzed for the umpteenth time that day. He recognized the number – it could only be Jag Ram.
Jag Ram wasn&amp;rsquo;t your typical Subedar Major (SM Sahib). A former wrestler, his imposing size and booming voice were legendary within the battalion.</description>

      <description>Some childhood memories latch on
Adhered to the body
Imprinted on the soul
Chasing after the kites
Rolling down the fields
Soaring alongside paper planes
Jumping in the brisk waters of Thopal
It feels as if the red dust from the slopes
still clings to my skin
The nameless shadows
The faceless memories
The children’s shrills of excitement
Remembering all the wild berries
Amla, Amaro, and Tindu fruits
Now feeling as though this life is but a shadow</description>

      <description>Retaining the vanishing shadows,
From the nostalgic past,
As her image descends to oblivion.
Striving to capture a moment,
Before it melts like a snowflake.
Seizing the moment of collecting the pieces,
Of the glass that once mirrored her,
Suspending pulsation,
the beats of aham,
Being there to capture the last simulation.
I have not waited enough,
For eternity spreads incessantly,
With floating particles like me.
Just a tiny firefly in the tempest.</description>

      <description>Forgetting Forms as if vanish sometimes,
With just names in the heart,
Repeating after the beats,
Aching and agonizing beats,
Itching like the old scars.
And some enduring forms,
Vanishing forms with blurry names,
Fire crackles with intermittent flares,
Mind wonders to name the whisper,
The whisper of birth and of death.
Caught among the nameless feels,
Hooked in the memory of pain.
Like the footprints after a rain,
Unknowable something,</description>

Sometimes a man goes to place so much better than where he stays or usually operates
that he gets a glimpse of the belief in the existence of higher loka-s or svarga-s.
As he wanders around that place,
he witnesses an abundance of things that so rare in his own
and has an intensity of experience much stronger than in his own.
Most denizens of that place have their own higher lives</description>

      <description>All-knowing Today I am having compassion for the being that is said to be all-knowing. and this compassion extends also to my philosopher colleagues who have extensively worked on omniscience. For every fact, there are millions of fabrications. One cannot actually know what love is like without experiencing it first hand. But what about hate? But I am more worried about knowing things like infinity. I do not think that all-knowing entity has not fathomed it, but then that would be finite.</description>

Peeping through the window at dawn,
I seek the aurora wrapping the peaks of Annapurna,
Adorned with the footsteps of Shiva,
In the first radiance of the day.
Morning chorus of drongo birds,
And some echos of temple bells,
Still evoke the sense of home,
Nothing but some scars of time.
The white silver turning gold,
With the sun reaching sunset hills,
Unleashing horses for some water,
Before resigning for the day.</description>

for my presence should not shadow their being.

the mouths that once chanted mantras
now ooze out blood.

I had the spells to heal the world.

      <description>Professor Max Müller has been so long and widely known in the world of letters as to render any formal introduction unnecessary. He has been from his early youth an assiduous student of philology, justly regarding it as an important key to history and an invaluable auxiliary to intellectual progress. A glance at his personal career will show the ground upon which his reputation is established.
Friedrich Maximilian Müller, the son of Wilhelm Müller, the Saxon poet, was born at Dessau, December 6th, 1823.</description>

      <description>Source: TW
Although intrinsically related, Jaati and Varna can be considered separate for the purpose of grasping the concepts. Even historically, Varna was not always discernible for there is no empirical laboratory test to determine the same. When the British started categorising Hindu communities into castes, they frequently ran into people who knew their jaati but didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what to make of the term &amp;lsquo;Varna&amp;rsquo;. That does not mean that Varna is expendable but quite simply that it does not lend itself to reductionist hot takes by politicians.</description>

Prof. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam - A Personal Reminiscence
-- Dr. M. Vidyasagar
Now that Bharat Ratna Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam will be the next President of India, I felt bold enough to peep into my memories and come up with this very personal reminiscence. Everyone knows about the various &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; incidents in Prof. Kalam&amp;rsquo;s life, so this reminiscence is restricted only to incidents in which I personally participated.</description>

Mother - the world is fearsome,
Let me stay in your belly,
I beg you chew me with your sharp teeth,
And dissolve me within you.+++(5)+++
Oh Karankini, do not let me escape your grips,
Ghosts and goblins in the cremation ground,
Are one thousand times better than maya.+++(4)+++
Oh Krodhana, have mercy on me,
Let the fire of your rage burn me alive,
And dissolve me in your purity.</description>

      <description>[Replug from April 2018] Adi Shankaracharya The Wikipedia entry for Adi Shankara introduces him as &amp;ldquo;an early 8th century Indian philosopher and theologian who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta&amp;rdquo;. It is reflective of the modern understanding of his life and achievements. Therefore, it is patently untrue.
The 8th century claim has, of course, been contested by the very mathas he established but there are even more significant things that would be called &amp;lsquo;problematic&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>That Kashmir earned for itself the title, &amp;lsquo;Rishi-waer&amp;rsquo; or the garden of Rishis, is not a matter of chance or romantic speculation. If you were born in Kashmir as a Hindu, you would have to be exceedingly obtuse to miss this glaring everyday fact of life. The valley was indeed a powerhouse that seemed to attract high-voltage specimens of our species. They were called &amp;ldquo;maet&amp;rdquo; in plural, crazy literally or &amp;ldquo;mastanas&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Two things happened today. First, I read about the statements on Kashmir made by a couple of Kashmiri Pandit ladies, Nitasha Kaul and Aarti Tikoo Singh (incidentally a darling of the Raitawing), at the US House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. I quote from the written statement submitted by the latter: &amp;ldquo;What the foot-soldiers of the Pakistani military and ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) have done to ordinary Kashmiri Muslims in the last 30 years, pales in comparison to the human rights violations committed by the Indian state.</description>

      <description>Like a Samurai,
The last rose in the garden,
Kept fighting for survival,
To defy the wheel of time.
And with the last petal,
Gave me the last smile,
It stood up against scorching heat,
But gave up to a gentle breeze.
A fallen petal does not come back,
But there will be new buds when the season comes.</description>

      <description>Cotton Balls
We all assume that teachers teach. This is self-given. But we all who teach know very well that we anticipate a clean whiteboard to start the class. I get so annoyed when some math teachers are too tired to clean the board. Teaching is a tender balance between spelling new scripts and erasing the old ones. Actually memory and forgetting are like two sides of the same coin of being.</description>

people admire me and look at me with disbelief.
I didn’t run away. My father walked with me for an entire hour till the dawn.
My father didn’t have this luxury.
He left home to go to Gurukula at the age of six. All by himself.
Unfortunately my grandfather passed away when my father was ten</description>

Makes you wonder why they stopped here
Wagon must have lost a wheel
Or they lacked ambition one
In the great migration west
Separated from the rest
Though they might have tried their best
They never caught the sun
So they sunk some roots down in this dirt To keep from blowin&amp;rsquo; off the earth
Built a town right here
When the dust had all but cleared</description>

In the beginning was just night,
Enveloped by the thicket of dark,
A spark called life,
An ephemeral emanation.+++(5)+++
We crashed from nowhere,
Being in the middle of a saga,
Waking against a tempest,
In a sinking ship.+++(5)+++
Close our eyes to avoid monsters,
For shadows have us owned,
Flickering spark in the midst,
Confronts this mighty dark.
One last laugh,
One last sport,
One last gaze,
And shadows take over.</description>

This lonely palm,

My being intertwined with his.

The palm just is,
Indifferent,+++(5)+++
Lonely is the concept he lacks,+++(5)+++
Happy in the slumber of pure being.</description>

So close, so intimate,
Yet so forgotten is life.
Like the autumn leaves,
Waving with the final shower of beauty,
Before splitting from the mother tree.
A moment of nostalgia,
A moment of anguish,
Recalling sweet and sour footprints,
This is all I got,
In my lost time, walking through the sunset cliffs.
Some friends faded in memory,+++(4)+++
Others, swept in the tides of time.
Some chose to forget me,+++(5)+++</description>

Why look at such a rich tradition of literature to extract banal lessons on how to squeeze a little extra from your corporate job? Let us read stories for what they are and they will enchant us anew.
With all the news on the political front the same old, same old, perhaps you will allow me to indulge in a little tirade on one of my pet peeves &amp;ndash; courses on management techniques from the Bhagavad Gita.</description>

      <description>Allowing the government to take care of us is always about the tacit consent to removing our skin from the game, superficially akin to outsourcing the disagreeable or difficult tasks to experts but closer to giving up personal and communal responsibility. There is a line to be drawn somewhere but apparently we ran out of ink long back. It is a vicious circle that we descended into at the time of independence, or maybe even before that.</description>

      <description>The Epic of Gilgamesh is only major Mesopotamian literary text whose author is named. Reading the text, it’s easy to see why. Whoever he may have been, Sîn-Lēqi-Unnunni possessed the key quality that unites great writers throughout the ages - he understood people. Good writing must rest on particular human truths. In Gilgamesh, we see many such truths beautifully rendered. In this thread, I hope to examine just one of them: the transcendent power of male friendship.</description>

To visit the villa of my sister,
By the banks of Trishuli,

In the melody of Cuckoo birds,
The grove is still loaded,</description>

School one day, school one day,
It followed her to school one day
Which was against the rules.
It made the children laugh and play,</description>

      <description>In a recent conversation with a friend on the rising threat associated with speaking your mind in a typical American workplace, I remarked that the abandonment of the sacred realm in modern society has made people emotionally fragile and socially handicapped. In healthy traditional societies, the sacred belongs to the Gods. In societies that are falling apart, the idea of a jealous grandfather in the sky and his sidekick occupies that space but still manages to keep insanity at bay.</description>

      <description>Meaningful Life
I do not know when,
I found meaning to life,
And gave meaning to pointless things,
Forgetting all meanings were self-imposed.
And stopped fluttering like a butterfly,
In the garden of paradise,
And dragged the cart of success,
And made myself a meaningful ox,
I long for those meaningless days,
Those pointless laughters,
And a few drops of tears,
Not to make any point,
But just to live again,</description>

Brought me to the light of being.
You as the ripples of ah and m,
Gave first beats to the tiny heart,
And thus gave body to the being that was not there before.
You Shared your first breath,
And breathed through the tiny lungs,
Giving its first rhythms.
I live a borrowed being,
Now both as being and absence,</description>

      <description>New Doll
Translated from the original Bengali by Bhaswati Ghosh
Changing tastes There was a master craftsman who made dolls as playthings for little girls of the royal family. Every year, a doll fair was held in the palace courtyard. All other artisans accorded the master the highest honour at the fair.
When he was nearly eighty years old, there came a new craftsman. Youthful in age and fresh in his style, he was called Kishanlal.</description>

      <description>Nirvana
Sky covered with musky dust,
Slowly enveloping dusk,
Birds sheltered in the bamboo bush,
Singing the final songs of the day,
I gazed all the horizons,
In quest for the shadow,
That stole some strings of my heart.
My gaze in the empty sky,
Echoes the lost melancholies,
And Kama suspends his amorous play,
In the roars of the clouds,
Or the dazzles of the thunder,
As I search thy name and form,</description>

INTRODUCTION Trying to understand U.G. or his teachings is like trying to grasp the wind in the palm of your hand. Yet they are as refreshing and fragrant as a fresh breeze, but they can also be as devastating as a wild fire! They are as nourishing as the earth and water, if only we can just listen to them and then &amp;ldquo;forget all about them!</description>

      <description>IN FRONT the awful Alpine track
Crawls up its rocky stair;
The autumn storm-winds drive the rack
Close o’er it, in the air.
Behind are the abandon’d baths
Mute in their meadows lone;
The leaves are on the valley paths;
The mists are on the Rhone—
The white mists rolling like a sea.
I hear the torrents roar.
—Yes, Obermann, all speaks of thee!
I feel thee near once more.</description>

Understanding Sadhana through the Life of Sri Ramakrishna: The Experience of God Realization through Tantric Sadhana — IV
PRAVRAJIKA VIVEKAPRANA
Sri Ramakrishna had moved on to the level of Vishishtha Advaita, where he got a little bit of help from gurus. The first guru was Bhairavi Brahmani.
Sri Ramakrishna, by his own desire to realize the various forms of God, practised the well-known ways of reaching out to the realization of God.</description>

      <description>A One Time Chef It is hard to stop laughing when we remember pieces of our college life. I just woke up laughing this morning, recollecting one incident when I was deemed the best chef.
The thing is, Martin Luther in Halle those days did not have that many deshi students.
The student body organized a food-fest and there were students from so many countries participating,
but nobody from Nepal, not even from India.</description>

      <description>Trust To trust is to make yourself vulnerable.
And nobody likes that.
But all our social transactions are based on trust,
and so we seek that people trust us.
To trust is therefore to live in a perpetual dilemma of being shattered.
Some of us have surplus of trust.
We make our trust to translate into our faith.
And we trust on the dead more than the living.
And we enter the jungle of solipsism</description>

      <description>When you pour like the hailstones,
Or pierce through the skin like the needles,
Or you burn like fire under the feet,
I find in you my only friend.
In my worst days of solitude,
And the days of tragedies.
You are the only one that I count on.
You caressed my body along the wind,
When I counted stars with the street dogs,
When the world shattered and broke,</description>

Neither did the sun come and go.</description>

      <description>Revenge of a Logician Two friends grew up together in their gurukula, school. One studied astrology, another logic. They both became quite established in their fields. The logician (Naiyāyika) wrote a good number of commentaries and introduced some new categories. The astrologer made tons of money. Tired of his poverty, the logician embarked to see his successful friend and ask for his help.
It is hard to imagine how quickly people change when they become successful.</description>

When Gods Wake Up – What the movie ‘#Kantara’ means for Hindus. Raw! Visceral! Existential! Unprecedented! And flagrantly Hindu! That is what Kantara is, and oh how! It is a celebration of ‘Being Hindu’. It is a movie made by the Deva himself. This is how.
Kantara completely inverts the way the colonized Hindus have been interpreting their own world, culture and civilization to the world in the past 200 years and inverts it to bring it back to its original position – fearless, unconscious recognition of the Divine all around us!</description>

      <description>Learnings from the reactions to pashubali from the krantikaris of modern India:
There is little to differentiate a rootless liberal from a political Hindu when it comes to their views on Dharma. Modern Hindus lack a basic understanding of fundamental aspects/concepts of Dharma like sampradAya, adhikAra, shAstra, pramAna etc. Respect for figures of authority like the revered AchAryas is completely missing and so is an awareness, much less the appreciation, of the rich dialectical tradition they have unfortunately inherited.</description>

Closed my eyes,

And a vulture thought I was dead.
When I woke up,
they were all gone.</description>

      <description>Ecological concern ecological concern is not just an environmental concern; it also is not our concern for other species. at the end of the day, it is the search for our own lost soul. we are the only species capable of making a difference and saving species. nature has given us that power. it is about how we embrace our responsibility.

Shall not compromise decency forever.

They had allotted the names of eleven animals, and were won- dering what name to give to the very first year, when the camel and the rat began to quarrel as to whose name should be included. In order that neither of them should feel affronted, the Tathāgata appeared and told them to decide for themselves.</description>

The urge inside like tidal waves,
Shake me numb, begging to recall.

Names and forms appear and vanish,
I urge myself to remember,
It is like dense darkness,
Or a thick fog covering all-around,
Like a cataract of the mind,
The one that Vasubandhu had,
But now may be I recall,
These must be the words,</description>

      <description>A hundred thousand years ago, we were just noisy apes halfway up the forest food chain. Then something happened. We gave up the insistence on close blood ties to form the bonds of trust. We learnt the art of large-scale collaboration. Sapiens began to dominate the planet and raced to the top of the pyramid. This rush to the top, attributable entirely to a large number of homosapiens working towards common objectives was made possible by the art of storytelling.</description>

      <description>Formed as shadows,
Part unfinished,
Crawl around and complain,
Eager like children running around,
The world is not a place for the speech to unfold.
In the speech I offer myself,
Vac,
the pristine expression of being as such,
Not as me and you but both me and you.
The song I have cannot be sung,
As I am one with the song,
And when I come out the song is gone.</description>

      <description>Today the memory of professor Rishi Ram Pokhrel is resurfacing since early morning.
I am not connected with him in any social media
but if any of you are in contact with him, please convey my regards.
Particularly coming vivid today is an incident that changed my life forever.
When I was an undergraduate student, professor Pokhrel was the college principal.
One evening when I was heading out of campus, the college guard stopped me and said,</description>

However, the paediatrician over there just told us that my child is suffering from acute pneumonia and she needs to be operated immediately (There was no symptoms and my sister countered him but she cannot to do anything as he was the paediatrician).</description>

Just because I have not seen you for a while,
Have not touched your outcrops,
Mixed my breath with yours,
And listened to the songs in your garden,
Do not think a minute goes by not thinking about you.
If not for this lockdown,
I would have grabbed my hiking stick,
And would have jumped up and down,
Your hills and valleys,
And birds would have followed me,</description>

So here is an interesting story from a place close to my hometown. Long ago, during when Goa was undergoing strife a Saraswat Brahmin family migrated to coastal Karnataka and moved to an interior place. They brought with them an amsha of their kuladevi. They were given land by the Jain landlord of that area for the Brahmin was able to cure an ailment in the landlord&amp;rsquo;s family with the gandha and tIrtha offered to the Kuladevi.</description>

The following paper discusses some issues commonly raised in regard to the relationship between science and spirituality. In particular, I wish to examine the issue of the apparent similarities (or symmetry) between statements made by scientists and those made by mystics concerning the unity of existence (or of the universe).</description>

First of all, both the words are not properly translated in this English rendering. But you got the idea.

      <description>Non-duality of Sevā
Problem It makes sense that we do not call sevā when we are serving ourselves, when we are fulfilling our own needs or when there is nobody but ourselves benefitting from it. But this raises a question, can we perform sevā recognizing non-duality? How can a liberated person who does not recognize the other as the other still serve the other?
Duality within non-duality The premise that sevā rests on duality is a huge misconception.</description>

A friend posed a good question. I keep repeating that Shakti puja, durga upasana etc is the key to dharmic revival. Well, maximum Durga pujas happen in Bengal and we can see where the state has landed with 30% ROP followers, matter of few decades when they will take over, and the Hindus specially Kolkata aantel types are all secular dhimmified suicidal maniacs who are beyond reason and arguments.</description>

Buddha watches his last desire,
The last lust,
And sees,
How desires overpowered him before,
And how feeble the desire had become now,
That it is begging to be there,
In a corner of his chest.
The beautiful daughter of death,
Spreads her bosom with hopes,
Not knowing,
The seed of passion that she thought,
Was actually the seed of compassion,
Now blossoming in her,</description>

She called me from New York and asked me if I could write a note on how these tapes came about. I gratefully answered.
When U.G. invited me in July 1978 to come to Bangalore, where he stayed in his friends&amp;rsquo; house and from where he arranged his Indian travels in those times, my immediate answer was, &amp;ldquo;Yes Sir, I would like to.</description>

Every knock on the door,
Wakes me up,
Disrupting slumber,
Forcing me to peep through the window,
Reluctant to open the door.
Tik, tik, tik,
Comes the knock again,
Chilling the spine,
But nothing is there except for darkness,
Just darkness swallowed into darkness,
Kalidasa tries to pierce through darkness,
I just throw a rock and go back to bed,
No dreams other than the knocks,
For every pulsation becomes the beats,</description>

Remember the days when we would run out to the new sun every morning and sing with birds and run with the wind? I am not talking about you but about those who were born before the machine age. In those days kids were allowed to have a life and our growth was not measured on the equations we could solve. When I walked out to the sun this morning, I reminisced the first touch of sunlight in the morning and I could not stop indulging myself of being in the nature even though I myself have sold my soul to the machine life.</description>

In the world that he has not seen,
Having been born blind.
Seeing the world, a riddle,
A puzzle, more than a paradox,
We are our own riddle,+++(5)+++
Like the seer who was blind.
Staying awake in the dark,
And seeing darkness in the light,
He seeks to be inspired,
By the setting sun,
That never touched his eyes.+++(4)+++</description>

Teachers Never Die Teachers Never Die. I used this exact copy of Bhuṣaṇasāra 35 years ago, when I studied with Bidur Paudyal. My friends evolved and did great many things in their lives. I, on the other hand, am stuck with the same old book, reminiscing the old times. Students are transitory.</description>

There is no counting of the times I have cried - Sometimes even not knowing why.
I remember crying, actually following my sister,
when the doctor gave up on my mother.
My father asked why was I crying and since I did not know,
I looked at my sister.
Mother survived but I never forgot the scene.
I remember some drops falling when I was with my friends offering flowers to BP Koirala.</description>

      <description>U.G.: NEITHER KNOWLEDGE NOR WISDOM THERE IS NOBODY THERE
By
Jean-Michel Terdjman
What U.G. is telling us is not contradictory, incoherent or illogical. It may seem so because we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to take it. We don&amp;rsquo;t know how to take it because what has been called his &amp;ldquo;teaching&amp;rdquo; is no teaching at all. U.G. is always enunciating mere statements of fact, in their rawest possible form. He does not provide us with the context, the perspective necessary to see how they fit.</description>

      <description>The House
He said he would build a house,
I could not say no.
He dragged his old body,
And devised his own methods,
With eight chambers and nine windows,
One day he asked, why was I not there,
To celebrate the house,
To belong somewhere,
And to scream,
With my arms spread,
This is mine!
But there were no flights,
He wished to see me before leaving,
And the next day he left.</description>

It was a day hike,
Started before the sunrise,
When birds were singing the first Sama,

I crossed the same river many times,
Or may be different rivers once each,+++(5)+++
For the slopes were confusing,
Carved with countless hills.
It was a walk without a destination,
Aimless strolling,
And some friends showed me the summit,
That gave meaning to their hike.+++(5)+++
I made some friends and lost some,</description>

I am not talking about you but about those who were born before the machine age.
In those days kids were allowed to have a life and our growth was not measured on the equations we could solve.
When I walked out to the sun this morning,</description>

      <description>In the dry air of San Diego,
And the bright sunlight,
On top of Iron Mountain,
In the songs of mockingbirds.
I smell humidity today,
With storms gathered around,
Tall shadows of snowy peaks,
Reflecting the cuckoo songs.
The banks of Kali summon me again,
The footsteps left behind even before I knew shame,
Like a kite anchored away,
Magnetic force pulls me again.
Far gone are the childhood friends,</description>

      <description>Shorts Every society or civilization is founded on myth. It is not the power of truth but of myth that keeps the culture alive. The first liberation is to free oneself from these constructions.
Freedom It is the inner drive, a surge of being that overpowers the conditions of us being in whichever states. This is not a judgment upon something, this is not a philosophy or politics. We do not explore freedom, it is the other way around.</description>

U. G. Krishnamurti was born in Andhra Pradesh in 1918. He studied Philosophy in Madras University. He had early training in the scriptures and meditation. His quest, like many before, was spiritual&amp;ndash;to realize the Self. He is indeed said to have attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi. Notwithstanding, his quest remained.</description>

Family and friends,
Colleagues and acquaintances,
Do you ever feel?
There is a vanishing point,
Where the real characters,
Appear as familiar as the movie characters,
Like a comet tail,
Starting from the pole of the heart,
To the pitch dark oblivion,+++(5)+++
As if from the brilliance of sunlight,
To the night of the new moon,
My throbbing heart seeks rest,
Not in light but in the new moon,</description>

      <description>My father-in-law had often mentioned that his father (Baba ji) had prevented him from going to the US for further studies. Born in a village in western UP named Fazalpur (later changed to Sundar Nagar) in pre-Independence India, he worked hard and eventually graduated from IIT Roorkee and became the first engineer from the village. When he secured acceptance in a university in the US, his excitement turned to dust because Baba ji would not hear of him leaving the village to never return just like another person who had left the village some years ago to study in the US.</description>

      <description>Too many people suddenly feeling nostalgic about Bajrang Dal and VHP. They are lamenting that they are no longer a patch on what they used to be. Well, they were cut down to size by the bigshots as soon as they started smelling power in the 90s. The thing is the bigshots were uncomfortable with their existence because the so-called goons were no longer politically useful to them and only embarrassed them in the media, 5-star conferences, and lit fests.</description>

A hermit in Banaras told me the first day,
&amp;ldquo;You come here to learn, or to die.&amp;rdquo;
Seeing me intrigued,
He added, &amp;ldquo;and they are one and the same.&amp;rdquo;
Perplexed, I strolled through the cremation grounds,
Inhaling the air infused with the aroma of flesh.
First death came with Vedanta,
With realization that the I that went there was no more.
And came the Sautrantikas+++(??)+++,

      <description>all dreams come to an end,
on the crack of the shell,
on the first opening,
the first sound,
as darkness vanished and light flooded,
I was both inside and outside the egg,
my feet inside and head outside,
touching the beauty of the first dawn,
I lingered with nostalgia,
with anxieties and pangs of emotions,
watching the vanishing shadows,
of those who tormented me in the dark,
ready for the first flight,</description>

You can rest sometimes, you know.
And think once for a change,
If the fight was yours,
Or was the one given to you.
I honor your heart, if not the fight,
For the noble cause you thought the fight was for.
From the left and the right,
You thought your fears were real worth fighting for.
Buddha would have said, I think,
The left is what makes the right,</description>

It was early in the morning and there was a knock on the door. Vikas was too tired to even think about who it could be. He opened the door.
Outside was a bearded man, his eyes lined with kohl and anger. Behind him were two hefty men carrying what appeared to be heavy sticks.
&amp;ldquo;Vikas?&amp;rdquo; asked the man. Vikas nodded and noticed the name on his green-and-green uniform.</description>

      <description>Wind Chimes
Last few days have been windy,
And the chimes are singing,
Stirring emotions from beneath surface,
Seeking any form to erupt out.
They chime melancholiness,
With a surge of momentariness,
Pushing me sometimes in between,
My waking and dreaming states.
Directionless wind, seeking its voice,
Assembles in my mind,
And the wavering sounds,
Probe my heart for pangs,
Where echos form the empty ground.</description>

The Hong Kong film industry was called the Hollywood of the East.
Film historians talk about the glorious 1980s to the early 2000s when the Hong Kong film industry produced several international hits. These films were largely action thrillers or Kung Fu films that caught the fascination of the western world.</description>

      <description>Poetic vision We are woven twice, in two different layers of our being. The first is when the being or sat expressed itself, it being manifest as mantras. We then were the songs articulated by the first poet, Brahmā. But his poetry lacked shades and needed more colors to be infused. His grandson Shukra made it possible, weaving the threads, the chandas, once again. His love for Divyā, a demon princess with a divine name, explains the paradox behind this poetic vision.</description>

      <description>I am in mood today to share you some stories that I have never shared with anybody. It was around 1989. I was back to Kathmandu that time and my guruji [Prem Chetan] insisted that I perform the ritual of life-installation for one temple. I was actually commissioned by Aishwarya Shaha, the Queen of Nepal. And for the days long life-installation prāṇa-pratiṣṭhā ritual ( Krishna temple in Bhimsengola, Purano Baneshwar), the queen gave me six rupees [about a dime] for dakṣiṇā.</description>
