      <description>Baa, baa, black sheep,
Have you any wool?
Yes, sir, yes, sir,
Three bags full;
One for the master,
One for the dame,
And one for the little boy
Who lives down the lane.
Baa, baa, black sheep,
Have you any wool?
Yes, sir, yes, sir,
Three bags full.</description>

      <description>Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the king&amp;rsquo;s horses
and all the king&amp;rsquo;s men
Couldn&amp;rsquo;t put Humpty together again.</description>

Went up the hill

Jack fell down and broke his crown
And Gill came tumbling after.</description>

      <description>Mary had a little lamb,
Little lamb, little lamb,
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went,
Mary went, Mary went,
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.
It followed her to school one day,
School one day, school one day,
It followed her to school one day
Which was against the rules.
It made the children laugh and play,</description>

      <description>Ring-a-ring o&amp;rsquo; roses,
A pocket full of posies,
A-tishoo! A-tishoo!
We all fall down.</description>

Born on a Monday,
Christened on Tuesday,

Took ill on Thursday,
Grew worse on Friday,
Died on Saturday, Buried on Sunday,
That was the end,
Of Solomon Grundy.</description>
